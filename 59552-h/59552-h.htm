An important phase in the life of
Panizzi has now been entered upon;
but before detailing the facts, we premise
that the high position then within
his grasp was not achieved without
considerable pain and heartburning, owing to the ungenerous
statements of the Press.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sir Henry Ellis having attained, in 1856, his seventy-ninth
year, it was not a matter of surprise that his
failing energies became inadequate to the duties
entailed upon him as head of the British Museum;
indeed, he must himself have felt the necessity of retiring.
He was, however, forestalled in this intention
by a private request, delicately conveyed to him with
liberal terms attached. The understanding was that
he should voluntarily resign, and should receive the
full amount of his salary and emoluments as a
superannuation allowance. Complying with this
offer, he accordingly tendered his resignation, and, on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>the 9th of February, 1856, the Trustees passed a resolution
thanking him for his long services. No
sooner had this decision been made public than a
certain newspaper, having received information of his
probable successor, was guilty of publishing the annexed
ungenerous paragraph, eminently calculated to
wound, as it did, the susceptible feelings of Panizzi:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“February 25th, 1856.</div>

<p class='c001'>“We understand that Sir Henry Ellis has resigned the
situation of Principal Librarian. The majority of persons employed
in that Institution, and of the public who frequent it,
would be delighted at an event that ought to have occurred
many years ago, if it were not that an extraordinary influence
is likely to obtain the appointment for a foreigner. It is of
the highest importance that this affront to British genius and
character be avoided, and that the right man be put in the
right place. When the Marquis of Lansdowne, from the best
motives, made the previous unfortunate selection, there was a
regulator that no longer exists; the vigilant interference of
the lamented Joseph Hume often prevented official tyranny
and petty vexation.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>In accordance with the Act of Parliament 26 Geo.
II. cap. 22, the Principal Librarian of the British
Museum is selected by the Sovereign from two persons
recommended by the Archbishop of Canterbury,
the Lord Chancellor, and the Speaker of the House
of Commons, who are (as has already been remarked)
the “Principal Trustees.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Up to the year 1850, it will be remembered that the
offices of Principal Librarian and of Secretary were distinct
appointments. The Secretary, whose duties and
position were at first simply clerical, gradually assumed
such importance that, though still nominally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>second to the Principal Librarian, he was practically
the Chief Officer of the Museum, not always acting in
unison with his superior in rank; it was found, therefore,
to be more desirable for the welfare of the
Museum, as well as more economical that the two
offices should be blended, and they were united in
the person of Sir Henry Ellis.</p>

<p class='c001'>In reference to this subject we invite the attention
of our readers to the following letter from that gentleman:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“British Museum,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>February 14th, 1856.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>“My dear Panizzi,</p>

<p class='c013'>You seem to doubt whether, in the event of my
resignation of office, you would be likely to succeed me in it.
I cannot help thinking that you must be mistaken, although I
have certainly heard that a candidate or two are either in the
field, or intending to apply when the resignation becomes a
reality. At the same time I must tell you I have heard no names.</p>

<p class='c001'>I think it quite impossible that anybody who has not had
experience in the Institution should be appointed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yours is, most unquestionably, the portion of the Museum
which is not only the largest, but the most useful and extensive
for public instruction; the time of life, the toil, and the
power of mind which you have brought to bear upon it and
upon its improvement convince me that no stranger, especially
without the knowledge which the experience of a quarter of a
century has given you in the view of general management of
the place, ought to be allowed to compete with you on this
occasion.</p>

<p class='c001'>I myself felt all which you now feel in 1827, at the time
my predecessor was approaching his end. I had aided him
with all my power for some years; and I can show you various
letters which are still precious to me, expressing his continuous
gratitude.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>A week or two before he died he said to me, ‘Well, Sir, I
shall soon depart, and you will be my successor.’ I said, ‘O!
My dear Sir, I doubt.’ He raised his voice and said, ‘Who are
they to have but you?’</p>

<p class='c001'>A stranger, you know, was put first, when the two names
were presented to Lord Lansdowne to lay before the King.
Mine was put second. Lord Lansdowne, from his own
knowledge of the experience I had had in the Institution,
powerfully seconded by the then Earl Spencer’s recommendation
to the same effect, gave the palm to the second candidate;
stating in his subsequent letter to me, that without any derogation
to the <em>merits</em> of Mr. Clinton, His Majesty had been
pleased to appoint me ‘Principal Librarian.’</p>

<p class='c001'>I cannot help thinking your fears groundless. I cannot believe
that any stranger, did he know the toil of mind to be
encountered before experience can be obtained, would wish
for such an appointment.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Four days after the receipt of the above, Panizzi
addressed the Archbishop of Canterbury and the other
Principal Trustees, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>>mutatis mutandis</i></span>, as follows:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“British Museum, February 18th, 1856.</div>

<p class='c001'>“My Lord Archbishop,</p>

<p class='c013'>Having just been informed by Sir Henry Ellis that
he has resigned his situation of Principal Librarian, I trust I
may be permitted to draw the attention of your Grace and of
the other Principal Trustees to my services, as giving me some
ground to hope that I may not be deemed unworthy of having
my name submitted to the Sovereign as being a fit person to
succeed Sir Henry. The efficacy and importance of those
services have doubtless been noticed by the Trustees at large,
as they were by the Commissioners of Inquiry into the British
Museum, as expressed in their report. I shall not, therefore,
presume to do more than refer with respectful confidence to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>the opinion which both the Trustees and the Commissioner
entertain of them.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have the honour to be, my Lord Archbishop, &amp;c.,</p>
<div class='c011'><span class='sc'>A. Panizzi</span>.”</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>From the Lord-Chancellor he received the appended
reply, which needs no comment, nor could
Panizzi have expected his Lordship to act otherwise:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“40, Upper Brook-street,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Feb. 18th, 1856.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>“My dear Sir,</p>

<p class='c013'>In answer to your application, I can say no more than
that I feel it my bounden duty to consult exclusively the
interests of the Museum.</p>

<p class='c001'>You will, I am sure, feel that till I know who are the
candidates for the office, I should do very wrong to say more.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The Home Secretary, at that time Sir George Grey,
received, without Panizzi’s knowledge, several letters
from eminent personages, strongly recommending him
for the vacant post; to quote one of these will be
sufficient evidence of their tendency:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Bridgewater House,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>“My dear Sir George,</p>

<p class='c013'>Having served as Chairman of the British Museum
Commission, I have thought myself justified in writing to the
Archbishop of Canterbury on the subject of the selection of a
successor to Sir Henry Ellis. His Grace, who has received
this intrusion with indulgence, seems to desire that I should
repeat to you and Sir G. Lewis what I have ventured to state
to him. Without troubling you at length, I may briefly state
that, on the assumption that Mr. Panizzi’s qualifications for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>the vacant post would not fail to receive His Grace’s
consideration, should that consideration be favourable, my voice
would be at His Grace’s disposal to defend, if need were, Mr.
Panizzi’s appointment, as, in my opinion, the best that could
be made. I also adverted to some knowledge I happen to
possess of the considerate and benevolent character of Mr.
Panizzi’s dealings with a very interesting class of men,
his subordinates in the library. This feature in his merits
being necessarily less under public notice than others which
are too notorious to require my testimony, I considered it deserving
of mention, co-existing, as I believe it does, with an
assiduous exaction of duty, and an energetic exercise of
authority.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>This letter was sent, together with others, to
Panizzi, on the 26th of February, 1870, by Sir George
Grey himself:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“37, Eaton Place.</div>

<p class='c001'>“Dear Sir A. Panizzi,</p>

<p class='c013'>I have been employing my leisure in looking over
many letters and papers which accumulated during my tenure
of the Home Office. Among them are some relating to your
appointment as Principal Librarian to the Museum in 1856.
I send you three letters which I think you may like to possess.
When your life comes to be written, which I hope will not be
for a long time it is right that letters such as those should be
among the papers which will form materials for it. Of the
appointments with which I had anything to do while in office,
there is none which I can look back upon with greater satisfaction
than yours.</p>

  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Another letter, from Lord Ellesmere to Dr. Cureton,

Marocchetti; he will model a fine thing from your <em>massy</em> forehead,
into which so much brain and intelligence are stored
away. Is the subscription confined to the employés in the
Museum? I should indeed delight in adding my name to a

</div>

<p class='c001'>The actual appointment, under Her Majesty’s sign

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Panizzi had been privately informed of the intended
resignation of Sir Henry Ellis at least a month before,
for, on the 2nd of January, he wrote to Sir George Grey,
recommending himself to H.R.H. the Prince Consort,
under whose instructions the Hon. C. Grey wrote the
following letter:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Buckingham Palace,</div>
      <div class='line in7'>January 3rd, 1856.</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>“My dear Mr. Panizzi,</p>

<p class='c013'>Pray let me know what Act of Parliament it is
that regulates your appointment. The Prince will not lose
sight of this matter till a decision is come to, but he would

  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>However, notwithstanding the tone of this letter,
and whilst many others kept pouring in, there were
not a few persons who tried their utmost to oppose the
promotion which had been so well earned, and which,
it may honestly be said, proved afterwards to have
been so wise a step in the National interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>The earliest protest is one which, though insignificant
at first sight, is here placed before the reader,
because it was sent to Panizzi by Lord Palmerston,
who wrote on the 13th of March (1856):—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“My dear Panizzi,</p>

<p class='c013'>The enclosed, which has been sent to me, will
interest you.</p>

    <div>“<span class='sc'>The British Museum.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I protest against the advancement of Mr. Antonio Panizzi to
the office of Principal Librarian of the British Museum, vacant
by the retirement of Sir Henry Ellis, K.H.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>1. Because the appointment, the said Antonio Panizzi being
a foreigner, is an act of injustice towards English candidates;
a satire on the character of the Nation; and a discouragement
to the pursuit of its antiquities and literature.</p>

<p class='c001'>2. Because as the office involves the chief “care and custody”
of a National repository of objects of inestimable value, the appointment
is a manifest incongruity, and a most inauspicious
precedent.</p>

<p class='c001'>3. Because the office confers the power of granting admission
to the Reading-Room of the Museum, or of refusing it;
and it is not fit that National favours, or the refusal thereof,
should be received at foreign hands.</p>

<p class='c001'>4. Because the said Antonio Panizzi has had the audacity to
propose the dismemberment of the Museum, in opposition to
the express provision of the Act of the twenty-sixth year of
George II.—a provision which received the approval of more
than fifty members of various scientific societies in 1847.</p>

<p class='c001'>5. Because the said Antonio Panizzi, on account of the
failure of his engagements with regard to the Catalogue of
printed books, and the fictions and absurdities of the only
fragment thereof hitherto published, appears to have deserved
reprehension rather than promotion.</p>

<p class='c001'>6. Because it removes the said Antonio Panizzi from an
office in which, under the guidance of common sense, his erudition,
energy, and activity might have been serviceable, to a
station for which he appears to be unfitted by his arrogance
and irritability, as patent in certain blue books, and by the
notorious verbosity of his composition.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The Terrace, Barnes.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Can any protest be more short-sighted or ungenerous
than this of “Bolton Corney’s?” The concise
note of Lord Palmerston speaks volumes to the
discerning mind as to his opinion of such vulgar and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>insulting trash. But for his Lordship’s discriminating
kindness in forwarding the document for Panizzi’s
reflection and information, the matter would be
scarcely worth dwelling on for a single instant.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again reference must be made to Mr. Francis
Haywood, who, it will be remembered, was Panizzi’s
earliest friend at Liverpool, and who, it can well be
imagined, was delighted to see his <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>>quondam</i></span> Italian
and penurious friend of 1824 now at the head of the
greatest institution of its kind in the universe. Appended
are Panizzi’s letters previous to receiving
his appointment as Principal librarian:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“B. M., February 20th, 1856.</div>

<p class='c001'>“My dear Haywood,</p>

<p class='c013'>All my friends have always laughed at my
doubting to succeed; I alone have hitherto been mistrusting.
If I am now to believe what I hear and see in writing, I cannot
have any doubts. It seems, even to me, that the thing is
as safe as it can be. The Archbishop is as sure as the Chancellor
and the Speaker, and so is Sir G. Grey, from what I
hear on authority that I cannot possibly doubt. But the
thing is not done, and there is, therefore, the <em>possibility</em> of a
miscarriage. What pleases me is that in this house <em>all</em>—excepting,
of course, Madden and Hawkins, who looked to the
promotion themselves—are strongly for me.</p>

<div class='c011'>“March 4th, 1856.</div>

<p class='c001'>“My dear Haywood,</p>

<p class='c013'>I have information on the perfect accuracy of which
I may rely, that at Saturday’s Cabinet my appointment was
decided on. You may rest assured—there is no doubt.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of course you must be one of my securities for £2,500, I
believe; I have informed Booth, who is now my other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>security for £750, of what is likely to happen. Ellice wishes
to be my other security. The Master of the Rolls too offered,
and so did Cureton, my old colleague, who <em>cried</em> when he
learnt how the matter had been decided. You have no idea
how many friends have spontaneously come to my assistance.
But of the Government, Ellesmere has taken it up as a personal
matter.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>It is incumbent on the gentlemen holding higher
appointments in the British Museum to name two
securities; these, in Panizzi’s case, were Mr. Francis
Haywood and Mr. James Booth, both of whom, of
course, were accepted. In order to commemorate
the great event, the new Principal Librarian invited
some of his intimate friends to dinner at Blackwall,
amongst these should be mentioned Mr. John Kenyon,
the philanthropist, philosopher, and poet. This
gentleman died on the 3rd of December, 1856, and
as a practical proof of the esteem in which he held
Panizzi, left him a legacy of £500 and all his wines.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Lord Macaulay, who had been a Trustee of the
British Museum since February,
1847 (an office which he highly
esteemed, and to which he attended
with much assiduity and
greatly to the public advantage),
showed, as we gather from his life
by Trevelyan, no small anxiety as
to the impending appointment.
In writing (February, 1856) to Lord
Lansdowne, he said:—“I am glad of
this, both on public and private grounds. Yet I fear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>that the appointment will be unpopular both within
and without the walls of the Museum. There is a growing
jealousy among men of science, which, between
ourselves, appears even at the Board of Trustees.
There is a notion that the Department of Natural
History is neglected, and that the Library and
Sculpture Gallery are unduly favoured. This feeling
will certainly not be allayed by the appointment
of Panizzi, whose great object, during many years,
has been to make our Library the best in Europe,
and who would at any time give three Mammoths for
an Aldus.“</p>

<p class='c001'>With all due deference to Lord Macaulay’s statement,
we do not hesitate to say that the appointment
was <em>not</em> unpopular, and shall, therefore, begin first by
giving Panizzi’s letters, addressed to the Keepers of
the various Departments, some replies to these letters,
and afterwards a selection of other correspondence
from subordinate officers, summing up with sundry
quotations from the numerous letters of congratulation
from persons in various positions.</p>

<p class='c001'>In relinquishing the Keepership of the Department
of Printed Books, the new Principal Librarian thus
wrote to Mr. Winter Jones, his successor:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“British Museum, March 24th, 1856.</div>

<p class='c001'>“My dear Jones,</p>

<p class='c013'>I cannot quit the important Department, which for
the last nineteen years I have had the honour to direct, without
expressing to you and to those who have so much contributed
to augmenting it and raising it to its present state,
my heartfelt thanks for the zealous, intelligent, and unfailing
assistance which I have received from all in the performance
of my various duties.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>It is not for me to say whether this Library can challenge
comparison; but this I can truly say, that having been so
nobly seconded, it is not surprising if I have succeeded beyond
what I ever ventured to hope in July, 1837.</p>

<p class='c001'>I leave my old Department in your hands, confident that
its future head will continue to receive from all my late
fellow-labourers the support of which I feel so proud—that
by your united efforts its usefulness will increase with its extent
and its renown, and that you will all receive that meed
of approbation which will be due to your untiring and intelligent
exertions in the service of the public.</p>

a few for substantial benefits. It is our pride that

warmest congratulations on the attainment of a post in which

satisfy the Trustees by punctuality, diligence, and general zeal

<p class='c001'>Without harmony of action and due subordination, all must
be confusion in such an establishment as ours. I shall therefore
be at all times eager to support your authority, and to
follow your directions as the Principal Officer of the Trustees,

all those engaged with me in the Department of Printed Books,

for the advantage of this Department, and of those employed in
it, for the support of authority and for facilitating the due
execution of the orders, and a hearty compliance with the
wishes of the Trustees, is no more than was to be expected
from the vigour of your administration while at the head of
this Department, and the generous earnestness with which you
have at all times advocated the claims and supported the
interests of all those placed under your orders.</p>

<p class='c001'>I most fully concur in the views and sentiments enunciated
in your letter, and particularly in the portion where you urge
united and harmonious exertion and the utmost punctuality
and steady attention in the performance of our duties; and I
beg to assure you that my best exertions shall be directed

<p class='c001'>There are, no doubt, a great many improvements to be made
in the system and conduct of the British Museum; but they
still require much judgment for their introduction, that we
may carry with us, as far as possible, the co-operation of the
heads of Departments and the general concurrence of the

<p class='c001'>To the foregoing, other distinguished personages
added their congratulatory expressions. Testimonials
signed by attendants—even the bookbinder might be
adduced—poured in, and might be put forward, did
space permit, to prove incontestably that the appointment
was thoroughly stamped with public approval.</p>

<p class='c001'>Our documentary evidence has been copious, in
order to establish, beyond doubt, the fact that Panizzi’s
succession to the high trust to which he was appointed
met with general approval, and once for all to extinguish
the croaking of his few detractors and calumniators.</p>

<p class='c001'>So far everything was satisfactory. We cannot, however,
conclude this chapter without referring, briefly,
to the proceedings in the House of Commons, on the
21st of April, 1856, when Lord John Russell, in Committee
of Supply, moved the vote for the British
Museum; confining ourselves to those parts of the proceedings
which related to the appointment. Mr.
Monckton Milnes (now Lord Houghton) appeared to
object on the old ground of foreign birth; yet, this
very objector had signed, with others, the Report of
1850, wherein it was stated that Panizzi’s appointment
as Keeper of the Printed Books did <em>credit to the Principal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>Trustees of that day</em>; that he had answered all
accusations brought against him <em>with a success that
they</em> (the Commissioners) <em>could hardly have anticipated</em>;
that it was owing to his Report of 1845 that the
extensive grants for the purchase of books were procured
from Parliament; and that he had managed
the affairs of the Library, for a long period, with <em>great
ability and with universal approbation</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Those who defended the appointment were there:
first of all, the Speaker (the Right Hon. C. Shaw
Lefevre, afterwards Lord Eversley), who stated:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“For my own part, I am quite prepared, and so, I am sure,
are all my colleagues, to accept the responsibility of selecting
Mr. Panizzi, because I do not believe a better choice could
have been made. The hon. gentleman has alluded to the fact
of Mr. Panizzi being a foreigner, but that has been no unusual
case in the British Museum.”</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Mr.</i> (now Sir Austen H.) <i>Layard</i>, “... he was very
much astonished to hear his honourable friend object to Mr.
Panizzi on the ground of his being a foreigner, because that was
an objection which ought not to come from that, the Liberal,
side of the House.”</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Mr. Disraeli</i> (now Lord Beaconsfield), “... had no
hesitation in saying that, if the Trustees had not appointed
Mr. Panizzi to the vacancy when it occurred, as the reward
for his long and meritorious services, and of the intelligent
qualities which he had displayed, they would have acted with
great injustice, they would have inflicted a discouragement on
the public service, and they would have been no longer entitled
to the commendation and confidence of that House.”</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Lord John Russell</i>, “... he really thought that we had
become more liberal than that.... He thought that the
appointment of Mr. Panizzi had been fully vindicated by the
Speaker, and he trusted that there would be no further opposition
to the vote.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span><i>Mr. Monckton Milnes</i> said, in conclusion, “he should be
glad to hear that the appointment was confirmed by public
opinion, and justified by the conduct of Mr. Panizzi himself.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The documents already quoted, are, we trust, sufficient
to fulfil the conditions required; but we surely
ought to be more enlightened than to coincide with
the opinions of the early Romans, who, as Cicero informs
us, regarded the words <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>peregrinus</i></span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>inimicus</i></span>
as synonymous: (off. 1 xii. 38). <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Hostis enim apud
maiores nostros is dicebatur quem nunc ‘peregrinum’
dicimus.</i></span></p>

<p class='c001'>Be this as it may, it is pleasing to record that
those who knew Panizzi best did not regard or treat
him as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>inimicus</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>This chapter may be fitly concluded with the subjoined
copy of a testimonial as satisfactory and as
well-merited as any man ever received. It is in the
handwriting and signed by Mr. W. R. Hamilton, a
Trustee of the British Museum.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“The Standing Committee of the Trustees of the British
Museum think it their duty to address to the Government of
Her Majesty, in the form of a minute to be communicated to
the First Lord Commissioner of Her Majesty’s Treasury, the
following representation in favour of Mr. Antonio Panizzi, who
for many years filled the office of Keeper of the Printed Books
in this Institution, and was lately selected Principal Librarian
in the same Establishment:—</p>

<p class='c001'>‘The Trustees are fully aware that the exemplary activity,
zeal, and ability shewn by Mr. Panizzi, in the execution of his
duties as Keeper of the Printed Books, are well known to the
greater part, if not to all, the present members of Her Majesty’s
Government; but they wish, on the present occasion, to call
the particular attention of Lord Palmerston to the very remarkable
proofs which this gentleman has recently given of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>his devotion to the general service of the Museum, by the extension
of its means of contributing to the instruction and
accommodation of the public.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the expression of their sentiments the Trustees are
especially influenced by the deep sense they entertain of the
obligation they are under to Mr. Panizzi for the suggestion of
the building recently erected in the Interior Quadrangle of the
Museum for supplying additional room for the books composing
the Museum Library, and for the better accommodation
for an increased and increasing number of visitors to the Reading-Room.</p>

<p class='c001'>The success which has attended the erection of this Building,
the universal admiration which it has excited among the
thousands who have been admitted to view it since it was
completed, the various excellent and simple arrangements for
the supply of books to the readers, the ingenuity and invention
displayed for the arrangement of a very large library within a
very limited space, and the facilities which it may eventually
afford for extending the available space for other departments,
the novelty of the design and the comparatively small cost of
the construction are all in a very great manner to be attributed
to the energy and inventive powers of Mr. Panizzi whose views
have been most efficiently carried out by the architect, Mr.
Sydney Smirke, in the material construction of a building
which, the Trustees believe, is without a rival on the Continent.
All these facts are, however, too well known to Lord Palmerston
for it to be necessary for the Trustees to dwell upon them
further; but they confidently hope that the circumstances of
the case will be found sufficient to induce Her Majesty’s
Government to testify their appreciation of what Mr. Panizzi
has thus done for the public benefit in such manner as may
appear to them most expedient.’</p>

Panizzi was called upon, within a few
months after his appointment, to give
practical proof of that energy which
characterized him; indeed, it appears
that he lost no time in setting to work
to reform the Museum as regarded the want of space
and the improvement of the position of his subordinates.
The Parliamentary papers of the day will
show the amount of correspondence, both private and
official, through which he had to wade. Though
desirous of maintaining chronological order, we first
take up here for a moment what, at the time, was
considered a valuable bequest of Sir William Temple,
brother of Lord Palmerston, who died in London on
the 24th of August, 1856, having for many years
resided at Naples as Minister Plenipotentiary.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was understood, previous to Sir William’s death,
that his collection of antiquities would come to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>British Museum. Although, perhaps, not a collection
of the first order, it was of considerable intrinsic
value, and looked upon by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>connoisseurs</i></span> as a small
Museum in itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the 11th of September, 1856, Panizzi received
the following private letter from Lord Palmerston:—</p>

<div  class='figleft id010'>
<img src='images/i_b_028.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“94, Piccadilly.</div>

<p class='c001'>“My dear Panizzi,</p>

<p class='c013'>My brother stated in
his will, ‘I desire that my collection
of Antiquities be offered to
the Trustees of the British Museum,
to be preserved therein for
the use and benefit of the public,
and if within six calendar months
after such offer shall have been
made to the said Trustees, they
shall signify their acceptance
thereof, for the purpose aforesaid,
then I give the said collection to them accordingly.’</p>

<p class='c001'>Of course it will be understood by the Trustees that
the Collection should be placed separately and kept
altogether, and be described as my brother’s gift, and the
Infant Bacchus should be added to the collection of which it
forms a part. As I cannot doubt that the Trustees will accept
this bequest, I would beg to suggest that some proper person
should be sent from the Museum to Naples, to pack up,
properly and safely, the things of which the Collection consists.
This would be more satisfactory than that the Collection
should be packed up by persons on the spot without any
responsible superintendence.</p>

<p class='c001'>Fagan is returning to Naples in the middle of next week, and
will take with him the list of articles, and the person sent to
pack them up might go out with Fagan.<a id='rA' /><a href='#fA' class='c015'><sup>[A]</sup></a> There are many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>reasons why it is desirable that no time should be lost in
packing the Collection up. The way of sending it home may
be settled afterwards. It is possible that some ship-of-war
may be in the Bay of Naples which might bring the cases
home, if not too bulky, but otherwise the Museum will make
proper arrangements for their removal to England.</p>

<p class='c001'>Panizzi immediately afterwards sent for Mr. Oldfield,
then an Assistant in the Antiquity Department
of the British Museum, and directed him to proceed
at once to Naples, in order to report on the Collection,
and superintend its departure. His instructions ran
thus:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“B. M., September 20th, 1856.</div>

<p class='c001'>“Dear Sir,</p>

<p class='c013'>After the full conversation which we have had on
the subject of the Sir William Temple’s legacy of his collection
of antiquities to the Trustees of the British Museum, it is unnecessary
for me to say more on that part of the subject, but
I have accordingly to request that you will take means for
leaving this country to repair to Naples without delay. There
the collection, I understand, is still in the house which Sir
William inhabited at Naples, and the objects will be delivered
up to you by George Fagan, Esq. (Attaché to H. M’s Legation),
who is in possession of a full and descriptive catalogue
of the said collection, and who is to act for Viscount Palmerston,
the heir and sole executor of the Will of his late brother.
You will, of course, give an acknowledgment to Mr. Fagan
of what you receive.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>The collection being speedily and carefully packed up, you
will make it your duty, without loss of time, to enquire by
what means it may be best transmitted to England. Acting
for our Trustees, I have applied to the Lords Commissioners
of the Admiralty, requesting them to order any of Her
Majesty’s ships that might be available, touching at Naples on
its way to England, to receive on board the packages containing
the said collection, the same being for public use and benefit,
and should you be successful in obtaining such means of conveyance,
you are requested to avail yourself of it in preference to
any other, even if the arrival of the collection were to be
thereby delayed. This delay would be of comparatively little
importance; what is really essential is that the collection
should be carefully packed up and safely removed on board
without loss of time.</p>

<p class='c001'>If no such conveyance can be obtained, you will then forward
the collection to England by the readiest and safest means
available to the best of your judgment, and after having consulted
with the gentleman in charge of Her Majesty’s Legation, or
with Her Majesty’s Consul General at Naples.</p>

<p class='c001'>As to the expenses you may have to incur for packing, packing-cases,
transport of the objects from the Minister’s House to
the ship, on board of which they are to be placed, you are empowered
to draw on me, either at a month <em>after date</em> or ten
days <em>after sight</em>, for the amount, advising me of having so
drawn, and carefully preserving the vouchers which justify the
expense. Should you be obliged to remain at Naples more
than is now contemplated, and find the sum of £50, which I
have placed in your hands to meet your travelling and personal
expense, insufficient, you are authorized to draw for £50
more on the same terms as above. On your return to England
you will be so good as to transmit to me a statement of your
expenses, accompanied by such vouchers as may be necessary,
in order that they may be laid before the Standing Committee.</p>

<p class='c001'>Immediately after the Collection is embarked you will be
pleased to make the best of your way back to England.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Having the greatest reliance on your judgment, I concur with
Mr. Hawkins in authorizing you to purchase, on account of
the Trustees, any object or objects which you might think a
very desirable addition for our Museum of Antiquities, to an
amount not exceeding altogether £100, drawing for the same
as above. Should any more important and peculiarly desirable
purchase offer itself, please to make forthwith a special
report on it, to be submitted to the Trustees, for their orders.</p>

<p class='c001'>It may be superfluous to add that it will be desirable that,
on your return, you should lay before the Trustees a report on
any point that you may think of importance, respecting
the public or private Collections which may fall under your
notice, and the regulations under which the former are preserved,
and made accessible to learned men and artists, as
well as the public at large.</p>

<p class='c001'>Be so good as to write to me fully and frequently for the
information of the Trustees, and give me the earliest notice of
the collection being on board the vessel which is to bring it to
England.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Fagan will assist you as far as in his power with his
advice and knowledge of men and things at Naples. I enclose,
moreover, a letter for Mr. Petre, now in charge of Her Majesty’s
Mission, and another for Mr. Craven, one of its members.</p>

Naples giving his private opinion of the collection,
which he evidently did not consider of very great
value. “The glass and the bronzes,” he said, “are of
considerable beauty and interest, but the sculpture as
a whole unworthy of acceptance.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A notable incident should be here inserted. When a
certain R. Gargiulo was preparing the Catalogue of the
Collection, it was discovered that four frescoes, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>not much importance, had upon them the stamp of the
Museo Borbonico. They had, in fact, been purloined
from that Museum by an agent, or ally, of the individual
from whom Sir William bought them. Sir
William resolved to return them to their lawful
owners, but died before carrying out his intention.
Mr. Fagan, with Lord Palmerston’s sanction, wrote to
the Neapolitan authorities immediately afterwards,
informing them of the discovery; stating also, of course,
how Sir William had unwittingly purchased objects
which he afterwards discovered had been abstracted
from Pompeii, and returning them in Lord Palmerston’s
name. After a few days, Signor d’Aloe called
on Mr. Fagan, and, stating that the matter had been
reported to the King, Ferdinand II., begged that Lord
Palmerston would retain the frescoes. Consequent
upon this, and upon the letter which communicated
the royal request, the frescoes were accepted.</p>

<p class='c001'>The collection consists altogether of 1,571 pieces;
of these the most interesting portions are the painted
vases, the bronzes, and the specimens of Greek and
Roman glasses. Special mention should also be made
of a magnificent <em>Krater</em>, with a painting of the death
of Hippolytus; a very fine and rare globular vase, with
an ornamental cover, should be separately mentioned;
and a <em>Lekythos</em> representing the judgment of Paris.
Amongst the bronzes, a small but fine bust of a faun,
and specimens of Greek armour from Ruvo, comprising
a breast and back plate, and a very beautiful
bronze statue of the youthful Bacchus, deposited in
the Museum by Sir William during his life-time.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the spring of 1857, Panizzi gave his serious attention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>to the cause of the staff of the Museum, and
to the increase of their emoluments. Hitherto the
servants of the Trustees, as it has been already observed,
were not treated or paid in a commensurate
manner by the Government, and no superannuation
allowance was granted; and it was properly remarked
at the time that, to carry out any effectual measure of
reform, it would be necessary to increase the value of
the appointments—thus holding out an inducement for
good men to remain, and giving the service of the
Museum the tone of a <em>profession</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>It would relieve the Establishment from persons
who were worn out or nearly so, and raise the general
standard of activity; and by clearing off an <em>arrear</em> of
superannuation, would make room for the early introduction
of a considerable number of officers and
attendants of a superior class.</p>

<p class='c001'>This step was ultimately carried out by Panizzi two
years afterwards, much to the satisfaction of the whole
Museum staff, as the following letter which they addressed
to him testifies:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Dear Sir,</p>

<p class='c013'>We beg individually and collectively to offer to you

</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>It will be remembered that in 1845, Panizzi, after
having obtained permission to visit his native town,
was, when on the eve of reaching it, stopped by the
Duke of Modena. Things had somewhat changed,
perhaps, for the better; or at any rate the time was
fast approaching when the foreign yoke was about,
once for all, to disappear from Italy, and tyranny
cease to exist in the land which had given birth to so
many eminent men. On the 15th of June, 1857,
Panizzi wrote to Lord Clarendon to obtain for him,
through Count Apponyi, an Austrian passport; his
Lordship at once set to work, and on the 17th of June
communicated to Panizzi the welcome tidings that
his Excellency, although he could not grant him the
desired passport because <em>he had never been an Austrian</em>,
still would not for an instant hesitate to affix his signature
to his English passport. Accordingly he started
by the end of August for Brescello, and actually
reached that place without molestation. He thus
wrote to Mr. Haywood from Milan:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“September 9th.</div>

<p class='c001'>“My reception has been all I could wish on the part of the
Government, and beyond belief on that of my few remaining
friends; for I find the majority of them dead. But those who
still live, and their families—I had left many of them children,
and I find them now married with children of the same age
that they themselves were when I left Italy—have received me
with a cordiality and warmth of affection that has often and
often moved me to tears. And then this country—and those
monuments—and this sky! Oh my dear Haywood, what poor
things are all those that are admired elsewhere! What nature
has done and what the old generations did for Italy is unique;
but I shall be very glad to be once more at the British Museum.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>Whilst at Brescello, the biographer, who had the
satisfaction of visiting that place in November, 1879,
was told that Panizzi spent the entire day going from
house to house seeing and embracing his relations and
friends, making researches in the archives, and taking
notes of all he saw; but nothing can be more touching
than a letter which he wrote on the 22nd of October,
1857, to Dr. Minzi, and of which we place a translation
intact before our readers:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>“My dear Minzi,</p>

<p class='c013'>How many things have happened during the past
thirty-five years! It was on this very day thirty-five years
ago, that you accompanied me, with Zatti and Montani, to
embark for Viadana.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was then that my travels began. What changes! What
fortune! How many sleepless nights! What follies! What
ardent passion! What sufferings! What risks! But no
more of this.</p>

<p class='c001'>You know that I have been at Brescello, but you cannot
conceive how dear such a visit was to me. Indeed it is impossible
to describe my feelings. I can only say that no town,
temple, or theatre, or palace afforded me such joy as I felt
when I saw Brescello; the church of Brescello! the theatre
of Brescello! and the Municipal Hall of Brescello! The very
house where I was born, yours, Montani’s house, and that of
Francesco Panizzi. These sights almost brought tears to my
eyes.</p>

<p class='c001'>You complain of my silence.... You must know that
weeks have passed without my being able to leave the house,
and that I was reduced to such a state as not even to get sleep;
my head felt giddy, and my heart beat so as to take away my
breath; I had pains in my hands and feet, and nervousness, accompanied
by continual noise in the ears. I went to Italy,
and now I tell you what I achieved since we last parted.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>From Keeper of the Printed Books, perhaps the most important
Department in this Institution, I was appointed
Director in Chief (Principal Librarian) of the Museum, about
two years ago. It is a very high post, but when I came to
take charge of the Museum, I found it so badly governed,
such was the need of many reforms, that it required an
iron resolution to replace order. I attempted it. Every one
in the service great and small (about 230) soon learnt that they
had to deal with one who was determined to make things go as
they ought. I was already known in my Department, which
was a model to all others, and every one knew the stuff I was
made of. I found a collection of 220,000 printed books, and
I left 530,000. I fought for years, defeated a squadron of
ignorant men and enemies, who opposed a plan for a new
Catalogue, which is now approaching completion, and which
will be the finest Catalogue ever compiled. I made a plan for
a Reading-Room to accommodate 300 readers, who are now
more comfortably seated than at their own homes, and of a
Library which will contain 1,400,000 volumes. The plan
was approved by our best architect; the room is now finished
and made use of. I am honoured by every one, and my
enemies have disappeared. All this has naturally added
strength and moral power to my new post. But, through hard
work, I felt as if my brain would give way, and so I decided
to visit Italy. There I slept very well, and the symptoms disappeared,
but they returned slowly. My mode of living is
moderate; I take medicine, but the pain on my left side has
returned. How it will end I do not know, for work I must,
and work hard too; and now that I have reached the summit
of the mountain I feel as if I should like to descend, but I fear
it is impossible. I am treated by every one like a Benjamin,
amply paid and much honoured, and they will not listen to
my retiring.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have sent you a selfish letter, such a one as I should not
have written to any one else, but only to a friend like you.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>To continue the thread of our narrative, a trifling
but pleasant incident occurred, two months before
Panizzi left London for the Continent, which we cannot
do better than narrate in his own words:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“B. M., June 30th, 1857.</div>

<p class='c001'>“My dear Haywood,</p>

<p class='c013'>A week ago the Archduke Maximilian, who is
going as Viceroy in Lombardy, after his marriage with the
Princess Charlotte of Belgium, came to visit the Museum, and
I received him. In the course of conversation it came out
that I was an Italian, and that I intended going to Renaro at
the beginning of August, returning in September. The Archduke
then began to urge me that I should on my return (for
he would not be there on my going) pay him a visit, that is,
<em>to go and stay with him</em>. Of course I said <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Domine non sum
dignus</i></span>, but he pressed me repeatedly. I thought when he
learnt who I was he would not press me again, but on Saturday
last I unexpectedly received a despatch from the Austrian
Minister here, Apponyi, sending me, in the Archduke’s name,
a very fine diamond ring with the Archduke’s initials, and a
reminder that he expects I will pay him a visit at Milan.
Now this is very embarrassing. If I go to Milan, and he is
there, I <em>must</em> present myself, and be his guest if he insists; if
I do so all the Italians who do not know me, more especially
in Piedmont, will accuse me of treachery, of playing false to
my country, and what not; and, on the other hand, if I had
the moral courage to despise such an outcry I might do some
little good—very little, if any, I know.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Yours, &amp;c., &amp;c.,</div>
      <div class='line in20'><span class='sc'>A. Panizzi</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>But to return to the Museum. The process of
accumulation continued, and the influx of works of
art and other antiquities was filling the National
Institution to such an extent that it was deemed
necessary to decide whether the Natural History Departments
should be retained at Bloomsbury.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>The various heads of Departments were invited to
send in their reports and opinions on the subject,
and a few of their remarks may not appear superfluous:—</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Hawkins, the Keeper of Antiquities, reported
that he could find no room for the cases of Assyrian
Sculptures which had arrived. Sir Charles Fellows
complained that Ionic Trophy Monuments and other
works of art found at Xanthus had been placed in an
unbefitting position. Dr. Gray, of the Natural History
Department, conveyed the pleasing intelligence
that if the Zoological Collection in the basement were
not speedily removed to a dryer place it would be
utterly destroyed. Mr. Brown applied for additional
room, as that occupied by the Botanical Department
in the basement was quite inadequate to its demands.
Professor Owen, in a report to the Trustees on the
same subject, January, 1857, approved of all the
statements of Dr. Gray, who, eight months later, came
forward again with a demand for his gallery and series
of glass cases, and the enlargement of the Insect-Room;
and two months afterwards he laid before
the Trustees a fuller statement. Many more examples
might be adduced, but the reader who desires to push
his investigations further should consult a lengthy
Parliamentary paper on the subject, ordered by the
House of Commons to be printed, 1st of July, 1858.</p>

<p class='c001'>Panizzi also wrote two reports, one dated the 10th
of November, 1857, and the other the 10th of June,
1858. In the first of these he fully discussed the
means suggested for relieving two Departments,
namely, those of Mineralogy and Geology, and then
continued:—</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span></div>
<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“In the Department of Prints and Drawings the want of
room, even to lodge the portfolios containing the collection, is
sufficiently shown by the placing of presses in the narrow passage
leading from the landing into the Print-Room. The display
of some of the best prints and drawings has often been
entertained by the Trustees, who felt how important it was
that this should be done, but who never could carry their
intention into effect for want of room. The Kouyunjik-Room,
by the side of the North-Western portion of the Egyptian
Saloon, had been built for the purpose of such an exhibition,
when the influx of Assyrian antiquities forced the Trustees to
devote that room to their display.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>It appears that the Natural History Department
will soon be removed. As there will, therefore, be
more space for a smaller number of collections, we
may hope that it will now be found possible to make
good certain deficiencies which have long been fully
recognised, especially in regard to the Exhibition of
Prints and Drawings. Glass and China too, will
form a most attractive feature in the new arrangements.</p>

<p class='c001'>The author himself has had ample opportunities
during the last dozen years of visiting some of the
most important Cabinets of Prints and Drawings in
Europe, and he has no hesitation in saying that no
single collection—not even a combination of two or
three—could compare with that of which our National
Institution can boast. Through the good taste of the
present principal Librarian, Mr. Bond, in placing so
many screens in the King’s Library, a step has been
taken in the right direction, and no Englishman—nay,
no Foreigner—visiting London should omit to inspect
this wonderful assemblage of works of art.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>It was Panizzi’s own idea that, as well as rarities
from the Library, specimens of the handiwork of
Raphael, Michael Angelo, Dürer, Rembrandt—and,
indeed, his own <em>$1</em>m>—should be framed and exhibited
to the public gaze.</p>

<p class='c001'>Instruction, practicable and visible, is one of the
leading features of the age; and it is our duty to
meet this increasing want by every means in our
power. It is not the feeling that in our hands are
the keys of knowledge which will impart instruction;
it is the practical and sincere wish to utilize the means
within our grasp, to educate the masses, which will
alone work a result so eagerly sought for, and so
materially tending to the benefit of future generations.</p>

<p class='c001'>The enormous pile of building which has just been
erected at South Kensington may, in a sense, be
said to owe its existence to the persistent efforts of
Panizzi, to secure more space for the collections he
loved so well. The two following letters on the subject
are, we consider, of great importance:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“British Museum, October 8th, 1858.</div>

<p class='c001'>“My dear Sir George,</p>

<p class='c013'>As neither you nor Lord John will come up
from Harpton Court to attend the meeting of the Standing
Committee at 12 o’clock to-morrow, I think it fair to ask you
both to give half-an-hour to the British Museum where you
are; and this might be even more useful than if you were to
attend the meeting.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Government are determined, it seems, to adopt the
principle of dividing the Museum; and Professor Owen, in his
address to the British Association at Leeds, having read an
article in the last <cite>Quarterly Review</cite>, drops his objections to the
separation, and is indifferent about the <em>site</em> of the Natural
History Museum: he only demurs to there being Trustees.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>Mr. D’Israeli says that the Government have evidence
enough as to what is to be done, and that they want no more
information. I believe he is egregiously mistaken, and that
the evidence hitherto collected is sufficient to prove that things
cannot remain in the present state, and that something must be
done; but there is no evidence or suggestion as to what that
<em>something</em> must be (excepting only that the Superintendent of
the Natural History, in the service of the Trustees, thinks that
his present masters, or anything like them, are not desirable.)
Now I have a great dread of these indefinite <em>somethings</em>. I
fear that one or two members of the Government who have
once walked through the Museum, or may have assisted at a
meeting of Trustees, may think themselves quite competent to
draw up a new constitution for this and other Museums, which
pompously and plausibly proposed to the Houses of Parliament
may be sanctioned, putting the British Museum and all its
collections in a worse position than they are now, and rendering
them less useful to the public. It seems, therefore, to me
that you and Lord John should consider well the subject, and
be prepared to advise the Government; and, if necessary,
resist any scheme that might be lightly or rashly introduced to
Parliament.</p>

<p class='c001'>I apprehend that, whatever be thought of Trustees, it will
not be so easy to persuade the family Trustees of the Museum
that they ought to be extinguished.</p>

<p class='c001'>I do not think that the Government have yet considered
which are the collections that ought not to be removed from
the present British Museum, and which are those that ought to
be removed elsewhere. We may agree as to removing the
Natural History collections; but is it quite clear we ought to
keep ethnographical collections and works of mediæval or
christian art?</p>

<p class='c001'>Has anyone thought how long it will be before what it may
be decided upon to remove, can be removed, what is to be done
in the meantime, and what alterations may be necessary in the
present building to fit the space left empty by the removal of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>some collections for the reception of those which are to remain
here?</p>

<p class='c001'>It seems to be generally considered desirable, if not necessary,
that whenever the Museum or Museums are re-organised,
lectures should be delivered by its officers. I humbly consider
this a great mistake. No one can do more than one
thing at a time well. A Keeper of collections will neglect
them to prepare his lectures, and a lecturer will hurry through
his lectures to attend to his collections; and if not more inclined
to one than to the other of his two trades, the same man
may be both a bad lecturer and bad Keeper of collections. As
the ‘Jardin des Plantes’ at Paris is so much talked of here,
with its numerous lectures, I trust some evidence will be taken
of its condition and of the working of its organisation before
we adopt it here.</p>

<p class='c001'>I should also think that before the extinction of the Museum
Trust is decided upon, it would be well to consider whether it
is desirable to allow Institutions like the Museum to be governed
by learned and scientific men. I will not go so far as to say
that the system of Trustees is the best that could be devised,
but I am fully convinced, and ready to prove from experience,
that learned and scientific men are unfit to govern places like
the Museum. Who then is to govern these establishments?</p>

<p class='c001'>There is a variety of minor points which are worth considering,
besides those above mentioned. If you and Lord John
were to agree to some general principles, I dare say Mr. Gladstone
would probably agree with you on the whole; and then
you three might induce, and, if necessary, compel the Government
to consent to adopting your views. I think it, however,
requisite that, in some way or other, evidence should be taken
from men whose opinion carries weight in these matters; that
the public and the Houses of Parliament should see that whatever
be ultimately done is done on good grounds and after
mature consideration. I think the information collected
would be of great use in coming to a right determination, and
I do not see how it can be possible to do so without.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>The ‘Supply’ is coming home with a cargo of antiquities
from Newton, and will call at Carthage for some fifty cases of
antiquities from Davis. It was to be at Malta on the 25th of
last month, and will therefore soon be here. Where is all this
enormous mass of things to be placed?</p>

<p class='c001'>“My dear Panizzi,</p>

<p class='c013'>I received your letter before Lord John went
on to Liverpool, and had some conversation with him on the
subject of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are, as it seems to me, two questions respecting the
enlargement of the British Museum. The first may be called
the legal question, which is raised by Sir Philip Egerton and
others—viz., whether Sir Hans Sloane made it a question of
his gift that all his collections should be kept in one building,
or whether, in dealing with these collections, there is a ‘will
of the founder,’ which the legislature is bound to respect, and
which is to be a law for all succeeding generations, whatever
additions the different branches of the Museum may receive or
require. If this view is to prevail, it is clear that we are
prevented from even entertaining any plan for the division of
the collections, whatever its intrinsic advantages may be.
But if this restriction upon the operations of the present
generation is not admitted to exist, then we come to the
second question—whether it is more expedient to enlarge the
Museum by adding to the present building, or by detaching
some branches of it, and providing them with a fit repository
elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c001'>I do not pretend to have mastered the subject sufficiently
to have formed a confident opinion upon it; but so far as I
am at present informed, the inclination of my mind is to
believe that the Natural History branches would be provided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>for in a separate building, and to a certain extent under a
separate management.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the same time, if the scientific men are to take up the
question as one of personal feeling and party struggle, and if
the cause of stuffed beasts is to be argued against that of antiques,
as if it was Whig against Tory, or Catholic against
Protestant, I am not prepared to say what are the advantages, if
separation are worth the strife and animosity, which its accomplishment
would create.</p>

<p class='c001'>A private gentleman, in arranging his expenditure, may
say—I allot so much for my kitchen, so much for my cellar,
so much for the education of my children, so much for my
garden, so much for my shooting, hunting, &amp;c., &amp;c., and each
of his servants must be satisfied with what they get. But
what sort of life would he lead, and how long would he remain
out of the Queen’s Bench, if his gardeners wrote letters
in the <cite>Times</cite> to complain that he starved his garden, and that
his hot-houses were in a disgraceful state; if his governess
persuaded Roebuck to bring the state of his daughters’ education
before the House, and if his huntsman inserted articles in
the <cite>Sporting Magazine</cite> in the style of Junius, displaying the
scandalous defects in the management of his stables. Yet,
with regard to luxuries, such as science and art, the Nation is
practically in the same condition as a private individual. It
must measure its expenditure by its means, and not, as in the
case of the army and navy, consider its necessities first and its
means afterwards. Yet the representative of each Department
of Science and Art insists on having the largest possible
building, in the best possible site, and each Department finds
successively supporters and champions in Parliament.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have no wish to volunteer advice where it is not asked;
if the Government think they can settle the question themselves,
I have no wish to interfere. My only fear is that they
may find it more difficult, on coming to close quarters, than it
appears at a distance. If the Government refer it to the
Trustees for their opinion, I shall be quite ready to take part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>in any Committee which may be appointed to consider and
investigate the subject. At present I don’t think the facts are
well ascertained, nor do we know what are the precise objects
which we should seek to obtain. I see, for example, a great
difference between keeping a great exhibition of stuffed
animals, &amp;c., for all the nursery-maids and children to look at,
and keeping a collection of Natural History for the use of men
of science—like the Anatomical Collection at Surgeons’ Hall
in Lincoln’s Inn Fields. I think that Lord John concurs
generally in the view that I have expressed, as to the removal
of the Natural History Collections.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is much to be said in favour of the constitution of a
governing body like the Museum Trustees. A body of scientific
men might expect and demand too much; they would
violate Talleyrand’s caution about excess of zeal. On the
other hand, it is desirable to relieve the executive Government
from direct responsibility in such a matter.</p>

<p class='c001'>Query—what is the oldest bilingual glossary of the Latin
language? What is the earliest vocabulary in which Latin is
explained by some other tongue? Is the earliest a Latin and
Greek (not Greek and Latin) glossary, or a Latin and Gothic
glossary, or a vocabulary in which Latin is rendered into the
Lingua volgare? If so, what is the date of the latter? I
hope you will not think this an unfair question to address to
so distinguished a <cite>bibliotecario</cite> as yourself.</p>

<p class='c001'>That Panizzi was equally interested in other Departments
of the Museum Mr. Newton could testify,
if need were, for that of the antiquities, and the
writer for his own.</p>

<p class='c001'>Between Mr. Charles Thomas Newton, C.B., and
Panizzi, there subsisted something more than an intimate
friendship; a more proper term would be a
warm attachment. We need no greater proof of Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>Newton’s devotion to his friend than the fact that
when in 1867 the latter was ill, and his life despaired
of, the former devoted all his time to the care of his
sometime colleague. The great number of letters
before us, from the hand of Mr. Newton, would indeed
fill a volume of most interesting matter, relating to
his discoveries and travels in the Levant; for he was
in the habit of communicating to his friend, it appears,
all his adventures, whether at Rhodes, Mytilene,
Budrum, or Rome. These letters make us wonder,
by their freshness, how time and inclination could
have been found to write them, and are certainly deserving
of publication at some future time. So much
important matter, from such a pen, would prove a
treasure to future antiquarians and travellers.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now Mr. Newton, who had been in the Museum
since May, 1840, was, in February, 1852, appointed
by Lord Granville to the Vice-Consulship of Mytilene.</p>

<p class='c001'>Whilst there, he carried on various researches and
excavations, sending home from time to time to the
British Museum the fruit of his labours. In April,
1856, Mr. Newton received directions from the Foreign
Office to proceed to Rome, to value the Campana collection
then offered to the British Government. On
his return from Rome to London he took this opportunity
to submit his views as to further operations at
Budrum; these he naturally explained to Panizzi,
and, through him, it was arranged that the two
should one day go to Brocket Hall, Lord Palmerston’s
country seat, and there meet Lord Clarendon, to talk
over the matter. Lord Palmerston, who was then
Premier, with his usual <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>savoir-faire</i></span>, at once suggested
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>that the Principal Librarian being present, and the
two Ministers being both <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ex-officio</i></span> Trustees of the
British Museum, the meeting of this triad might be
considered a quorum, for the settlement of a matter
of so much consequence to the National Institution.
It was then agreed that Mr. Newton should at once
proceed to Budrum on special mission. Those were
days when operations of this kind could be carried
out with that secrecy and despatch which are necessary
to insure success. In this particular case, there
was the more reason for prompt action, because
Ludwig Ross, a distinguished German explorer, had
already visited Budrum, and noticed in his travels the
Lions from the Mausoleum, then built into the walls
of the Castle at Budrum.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Newton’s demands were surely not exorbitant;
he suggested that a firman authorizing the removal
of the Lions should be obtained from the Porte,
declaring that the sum of £2,000, and the services of
a ship-of-war, for at least six months, would be necessary
to insure the success of the expedition. These
suggestions were, without loss of time, acted upon,
and H.M.’s ship “Gorgon,” commanded by Captain
Towsey, was chartered, and she arrived at Budrum in
the month of November, 1856.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is unnecessary now to say that the finding of the
ever famous tomb of Mausolus at Halicarnassus
(Budrum) was an event of the first importance to
Classical Archæology, or, what is better, that the
recovery of part of the slabs of the frieze of this
monument, along with other sculptures, was for the
history of Greek sculpture in the age of Praxiteles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>and Scopas, of the same importance, as the marbles of
the Parthenon for the history of sculpture in the time
of Pheidias. Several of the slabs of the frieze from
the Mausoleum had been obtained for the British
Museum, through the late Lord Stratford de Redcliffe,
some years previous to Mr. Newton’s expedition; but a
comparison of them with the newly-recovered fragments
at once shows how admirably the skill of the
artist, lost and obliterated in the older slabs, had been
preserved in Mr. Newton’s. It was not from the circumstances,
perhaps, possible to affirm that this or
that portion of the Sculptures was the work of
Praxiteles, or of Scopas; but this at any rate could be
said, that the Sculptures must be taken as works
executed under the eyes of these artists, and, doubtless,
greatly influenced by them. Here is what Mr.
Newton says of them:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“Budrum, 26th April, 1857.</div>

<p class='c001'>“My dear Panizzi,</p>

<p class='c013'>Since I last wrote, we have made some brilliant
discoveries. On the Eastern Side of the Mausoleum I have
found a beautiful piece of frieze, three figures, an Amazon
attacking a prostrate Greek, and a mounted figure.</p>

<p class='c001'>This piece of frieze ranges with that now in the British
Museum. It is in much finer condition, and is a most
exquisite specimen of high relief. Being found in the Eastern
Side, I think we may venture to consider it the work of
Scopas, because a block of that size could not have been
transported far without greater injury. On the North Side,
digging on beyond the apparent boundary of the <em>temenos</em>, we
came to a beautiful Hellenic wall about three feet behind the
line cut out of the rock, which marks the boundaries of the
quadrangle.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>This wall, built of isodomous masonry, is evidently the
boundary of the precinct (Pliny’s <em>circuitus</em>) on this side.
Digging beyond it to the North, I came to a magnificent colossal
female head lying in the ground. The hair is arranged in regular
curls on the forehead, and bound with a coif behind, like the
head-dress on the contemporary silver coins of Syracuse.
This head is one of the most interesting discoveries we have
made. It is in fine condition; the nose and mouth have
suffered a little. Following the wall Eastward from this
point, we came to a mass of ruins lying as they had originally
fallen. Near the surface was a Lion of the same size as those
in the Castle, nearly entire and in magnificent condition. We
have the two forelegs, and hope to find the paws. The face
quite perfect, the inside of the mouth coloured red, the very
roughness of the tongue rendered. This Lion, though
perhaps inferior to the rest in style, and not finished throughout,
is a most noble beast. I think the British public will admire
him, because there is so little for the imagination to
supply.</p>

<p class='c001'>While we were getting him out, we discovered a male (?)
head in three pieces, but capable of being united without
much loss. I think, an Apollo, exceedingly fine, on a smaller
scale than the other; also part of a horse’s head, on
an enormous scale, bigger, I think, than the equestrian
statue I first found. After getting these out, we came
upon a most beautiful draped female figure in very fine
condition, but headless; it is in two pieces, the first from
the neck to the knees, the second from the knees to
the feet. The drapery of this figure seems to me equal to
any in the Elgin-Room. The statue must have been about
ten feet long. As we were getting it out, we discovered
another colossal figure lying a little to the North of it. This
we had not time to get out yesterday, and to-day is Sunday,
so it must remain till to-morrow. I forgot to mention that on
the piece of the horse’s head a portion of bronze bridle, with
a circular ornament, was still fixed, but another piece of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>horse, with another piece of bronze bridle, was found close to
it. You see that these discoveries promise well. My impression
is that we are now, for the first time, exploring a
part of the site where the ruins have not been disturbed since
the building fell. Hence the completeness and fine condition
of the sculpture....</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>On the 8th of June, of the same year, again Mr.
Newton wrote to Panizzi;—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“You will rejoice to hear that along the Eastern Side of
the Mausoleum I found two more very fine slabs of frieze,
one nearly six feet long, with an Amazon on horseback,
sitting with her face to the tail, shooting at a foe behind her,
after the Parthian fashion—a most bold and vigorous design;
the other, a combat on foot. It is remarkable that these four
slabs of frieze have been found in a line on the Eastern Side.
This makes me think they are all from the hand of Scopas.
Together they make up about 16 feet, which, with the slabs
now in the British Museum, will make up a total length of
about 80 feet. I hope you have secured the Genoa slab at
any price.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the North Side, I have found the other half of the head
of the great horse. The bronze bit, in perfect preservation,
was still in his mouth! The nostrils are distended, much in
the manner of those in the horse’s head from the Car of
Night in the Elgin-Room, so that these two heads, the works
of successive schools, will be an interesting subject of comparison.
Besides this, I have found a face broken off from a
colossal male head. I think this belongs to the figure in the
chariot. It seems to be an ideal portrait, not unlike that of
Alexander the Great on the coins of Lysimachus. It represents
a man, perhaps Mausolus himself, in the prime of life,
slightly bearded. It is in very fine condition, and is, altogether,
the finest head I have ever seen, particularly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>interesting, because it seems to form the connecting link
between the schools of Scopas and that of Lysippus. I have
still got a good deal of ground to dig on the North Side, but
the proprietors are very obstinate.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>On the 17th of January, 1861, Mr. Newton was
appointed Keeper of Greek and Roman Antiquities,
then organized as a separate Department of the
Museum. From that time to now he has been constantly
occupied, with a success so well known that it
is unnecessary to refer to it. In the enlargement and
enriching of his Department, partly by the direction
of excavations on classical soil—memorably those at
Ephesus, which resulted in the discovery of the Temple
of Diana—and partly by the purchase of celebrated
collections of antiquities. Chief among his transactions
of the latter kind was the purchase of the collection
of the Duke de Blacas in 1866, which, as public
opinion testified at the time, was a most important
gain to the National Museum. The acquisition was
not effected without difficulties, as may be seen from
the following letter:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Hôtel des Deux Mondes, Paris,</div>
      <div class='line in13'>November 25th, 1866.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>“My dear Panizzi,</p>

<p class='c013'>Jones tells me that after the meeting of the
Trustees on Friday, Mr. D’Israeli had an interview with you
about the Blacas purchase. I write, therefore, to thank you
for having backed my recommendation, which I am quite sure
you must have done strongly, or otherwise the Government
would not have come to a decision so rapidly. I never was
more astonished than when I received authority to treat on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Sunday morning last. While we were signing the contract
poor DeWitte was at the Grand’Messe. ‘If I had only
known,’ he said to me afterwards, ‘two hours sooner what
you were about, I would have telegraphed to the Emperor at
<a id='corr52.5'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Compiégne'>Compiègne</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_52.5'><ins class='correction' title='Compiégne'>Compiègne</ins></a></span>.’ The French are greatly disgusted. From all I
can learn, they meant to offer about £40,000, and keep the
matter dragging on till they had found out our last offer. I
am very much pleased at the result, because I know how
greatly the value of our Museum, as a whole, will be increased
by this purchase, which supplies exactly what we were most
deficient in.</p>

<p class='c001'>There will, I have no doubt, be a great outcry in England
about the largeness of the sum; but I am perfectly ready to
bear the brunt of all that. The public will find out in time
what a prize they have got. I hear that Mérimée was very
anxious that it should be secured for the Louvre. He was on
the Commission, but was obliged to go South. Perhaps you
may be writing to him; I should like very much to hear what
he has to say about the purchase. There is no one who has
done more to defend my purchases than he has, up to this
date, so I hope he will now. I am going to see the collection
of M. Thiers to-morrow morning, and shall be curious to hear
what he says.</p>

<p class='c001'>We trust that we shall not be held to have failed
in our endeavour to do justice to the services rendered
by Mr. Newton to the National Museum. Apart from
the high attainments to which testimony should be
offered, this gentleman was so intimately connected
with the subject of the memoir, that the omission of
such a record would have been a serious fault, considering
the constant intercommunion which existed
between the two, and the mutual assistance they rendered
each other.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>As a conclusion to our present chapter, it must be

It may be readily conceived that Panizzi
did not regard as matters of secondary
importance, or affection, the affairs of
his native Italy. In the summer of
1846, being desirous of paying, for the
first time, a visit to Naples, he applied to the Government
of that State for the necessary permission through
Lord Palmerston, who addressed the following letter
to Sir William Temple on his friend’s behalf:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“September 25th, 1846.</div>

<p class='c001'>“Sir,</p>

<p class='c016'>I have to inform you that Mr. Panizzi, a native of
Modena, who has now been for many years resident in England,
who holds the appointment of Keeper of the Printed Books in
the British Museum, wishes to go to Italy in the course of this
autumn, and to visit Naples. Mr. Panizzi was, many years
ago, connected with some persons who, on account of their
political opinions, had incurred the displeasure of the late
Duke of Modena; but Mr. Panizzi has long ceased to have
anything to do with Italian politics, and confines himself
entirely to his official duties in England, where he enjoys the
friendship and esteem of distinguished men of all parties.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Mr. Panizzi, however, would not like to enter the Neapolitan
territory unless he were previously assured that he would
be permitted to do so without hindrance, and that he would
be free from molestation during the short time he might
remain there, and as many members of H. M’s Government
have a great regard for Mr. Panizzi, and feel an interest in
what concerns him, I have to desire that you will mention this
to the Neapolitan Government, and that you will state H.M.’s
Government would be much gratified if the requested assurance
could be given.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I have, &amp;c., &amp;c.,</div>
      <div class='line in15'><span class='sc'>Palmerston</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>After some delay, in consequence, according to Sir
William’s account, of difficulties raised by the Minister
of Police at Naples, the required permission was
granted; but Panizzi did not think fit to avail himself
of it upon this occasion. His visit, however, as will
be seen, was only postponed. It will also be noticed
that his influence was in course of time an important,
if not the main instrument whereby the liberation of
the unhappy victims of tyranny, then lying in the
horrible dungeons of Naples, was effected.</p>

<div id='i055'  class='figright id012'>
<img src='images/i_b_055.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c001'>In order to lay clearly before the reader the manner
in which such influence
was exercised, it
is best to give a brief
account of the condition
of Naples at and
about the period of turmoil
and revolution in
Europe in the years
1847-9, and of the
paternal treatment bestowed
by the Government
of Ferdinand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>II., monarch of the Two Sicilies (<em>justly</em> entitled to
the appellation of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pater patriæ</i></span>) on many of his
ungrateful and recalcitrant subjects.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the death (June 1st, 1846) of Gregory XVI.,
a pontiff with a true and earnest feeling of respect
for things as they are, and a righteous
aversion to all unnecessary and gratuitous reforms,
great expectations were anticipated throughout all
Italy of good results from the rule of his successor,
Pius IX. The most sanguine hopes were entertained
that, through him, the rights of liberty would be
secured; and indeed, as Gioberti says, he was regarded
as no less than the arbiter of peace in Europe.
Without casting the shadow of suspicion on the
genuineness of the new Pope’s good intentions,
whereof he gave ample proof on his accession to the
Papal Chair, it is nevertheless pretty evident that,
under the most favourable circumstances, these expectations
stood but little chance of fulfilment. Even
had Pius IX. not been deceived in the first instance,
and by subsequent revolution frightened out of the
liberal principles to which he at first gave his adherence,
he was scarcely, himself, in a position to carry
them into practice. To preach reform and constitutionalism
from the Vatican was to subvert the Papal
seat. External obstacles, again, would assuredly
stand in the way of him who should attempt to promote
even moderate reforms in an Italian State of the
period. Many men who, in other places, and under
other circumstances, would have been regarded as
models of enlightenment and moderation, shamed by
the miserable history of their country, and exasperated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>by long-continued oppression and misrule, had
become somewhat blind to the wholesome doctrine
that the art of construction is a chief constituent of
political order. To another party, formidable in
numbers if not conspicuous for wisdom, it was but
labour lost to proffer anything in the shape of reform;
these men would be content with nothing short
of destruction. Of them and their adherents Panizzi
has, as will be observed, expressed his fear and abhorrence
in no measured terms. Hence his alienation
from Mazzini, who, in his egregious selfishness, would
have destroyed the elements of power that existed, but
had never displayed the ability to provide a substitute.</p>

<div id='i057'  class='figleft id013'>
<img src='images/i_b_057.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c001'>Pius IX., whose intellectual
powers were far from
equal to the largeness of his
heart, soon became involved
in difficulties. His constant
dread of acting prejudicially
to the interests of the Church
weighed him down; and the
influence of Count Ludolf
(Neapolitan Minister at Rome,
well known for his retrogressive
opinions) probably
thwarted his good intentions in no small degree.
From want of confidence in himself, as well as from
despair at the impediments, subjective and objective,
which perpetually obtruded themselves upon him,
Pius had recourse for protection and direction to the
counsel of others. Ill advisers were those whom he
chose—Grasselini, Gizzi, and Antonelli. The results
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>of vacillation and evil communication were speedily
visible. Already, in November, 1846, a few short
months after his accession, in his address to the
Patriarchs and Archbishops, he roundly condemned
everything that bore the name of <em>Progress</em> as <em>seductive,
false, deceitful, seditious, foolish, and destructive
of ties religious, political, and social</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first notable act of the reign of Pius IX. had
been to grant a general amnesty to all political
offenders. This act of clemency, though it gained
for him a certain amount of well-deserved popularity,
unhappily smothered in the heart of Ferdinand II.
all the veneration with which that monarch had been
wont to regard the occupants of St. Peter’s chair.
The King even went so far, in his indignation, as to
stigmatise the Pope as the head of “Young Italy.”
With his people it was different. The sensation
created at Naples by this amnesty was intense. The
inhabitants demanded that it should be placarded
throughout the city; the King, however, not only set
his face against the proposal, but peremptorily forbade
all demonstrations in favour of His Holiness, suppressed
the sale of his portraits, and interdicted the
admission into the country of Roman newspapers.
Indeed, the very mention of the Pope’s name was regarded
as bordering on treason, and as calling for the
notice of the police.</p>

<p class='c001'>It might possibly have come to pass, had foreign
powers possessed more satisfactory relations with one
another at this time, that better order would, under
the pressure of external suasion, have been maintained
in the Government of more than one Italian State.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>The “Spanish Marriages” had created a coolness
between France and England, and M. Guizot’s foreign
policy had thrown France, so far as regarded Italy,
into the arms of Austria and the reactionary party.
The prospect of establishing civil and religious liberty
in the Peninsula looked extremely obscure. The
clamouring for reform, however, continued, intermittently
throughout Italy. In Tuscany there appeared
a speck of light in the surrounding darkness:
for, urged by his people the Grand Duke had shown
himself nothing loth to grant reforms demanded of
him. In Rome meetings and demonstrations were frequent.
Amidst all this Ferdinand remained unmoved,
notwithstanding the importunate entreaties of the
emissaries of Louis-Philippe, the Duke D’Aumale, and
Prince de Joinville. In fact his Majesty plainly and
deliberately gave them to understand that their presence
in his kingdom was undesirable.</p>

<p class='c001'>Liberty of the Press being excluded from the King’s
Dominions, its place was filled by the usual substitute,
the issue of anonymous pamphlets; amongst many
others, was one entitled <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Protesto del Popolo delle due
Sicilie</cite></span>, from the pen of the celebrated Luigi Settembrini.
This work, which was immediately seized,
contained a long and detailed account of the cruelties
inflicted during so many years by the Neapolitan
Government on its hapless subjects. A copy of the
pamphlet reached the hands of Ferdinand, who
determined that no pains should be spared to discover
its author. Suspicion fell on many of the leading
Liberals, who were consequently imprisoned, amongst
them Carlo Poerio, Mariano d’Ayala, Domenico
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>Mauro, and others. Banishment was the sentence
of those who could not be <a id='corr60.2'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='siezed'>seized</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_60.2'><ins class='correction' title='siezed'>seized</ins></a></span>, and amongst them
was Settembrini, who escaping to Malta, no sooner
found himself on safe ground, than he avowed himself
as author of the pamphlet.</p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile Calabria and Sicily were in a state of
fermentation, and the King perplexed by the general
condition of affairs, was induced to grant a general
amnesty.</p>

<p class='c001'>The North of Italy was at that time in calmer and
happier circumstances. Charles Albert, King of
Sardinia, had consented to measures of Liberal Reform,
and certain influential northern Italians, headed
by Counts <a id='corr60.14'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Mammiana'>Mammiani</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_60.14'><ins class='correction' title='Mammiana'>Mammiani</ins></a></span> and Balbo, Massimo d’Azeglio,
Cavour and Silvio Pellico, had petitioned Ferdinand
II. to make concessions similar to those they enjoyed
in their kingdom, but without avail. Nor was England
wanting in sympathy with the suffering, for Lord
Minto, by direction of Lord Palmerston, had arrived
from the North of Italy, at Naples, on an intercessory
mission to the King in behalf of his people.</p>

<p class='c001'>This interference of England caused much consternation
in Austria. Prince Metternich warned Lord
Palmerston that the Emperor was firmly resolved to
keep his Empire intact. His Lordship’s reply to the
warning was characteristic; that, although he respected
the rights of Austria, still he entertained a
strong opinion that the people of Italy had a perfect
right to use all legitimate means for their own amelioration.
At Naples, notwithstanding Lord Minto’s
mission, troubles increased. The King remained as
obdurate as ever, and was supported by the members
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>of his family, with the single exception of the Count
of Syracuse, who, for the expression of his views, was
forthwith expelled from the kingdom.</p>

<p class='c001'>Earnestly as England desired the promotion of
liberty in Italy, she was not unmindful of the safety of
Kings; and, consequently, the then British Ambassador
at Rome suggested that the English fleet should
proceed to Naples to protect the King, and that Count
Ludolf should be informed “that the encouragement
of popular insurrection formed no part of the hearty
support England was disposed to give to the progress
of liberal reform in Italy, and at the same time strongly
impressing on him the danger to which the King would
be exposed, unless he made some advances to satisfy
the just expectations of his subjects.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In December, 1847, a revolution of vast magnitude
was impending at Palermo, and in the same month a
final appeal was made to the King urging him to recognise
the rights of his subjects.</p>

<p class='c001'>The 12th of January, 1848, was fixed on as the day for
the expiration of this ultimatum. As heretofore, the
application was treated with contempt, and an armed
force was dispatched, headed by the Duke Serra
Capriola.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first shots were fired on the 12th of January,
the fête-day of the King, whereupon fresh troops were
sent from Naples with orders to Désauget, the General
commanding, that, in case of resistance, he should
<em>make a garden of Palermo</em>. Désauget accordingly
bombarded the town, but happily failed to make a
<em>garden</em> or a desert of it, and was forced, after losing
many men, to return to Naples. So matters went on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>from bad to worse. No sooner had the King made
concessions than he withdrew them, continually fore-swearing
himself.</p>

<p class='c001'>The subjugation of the Sicilians (in support of
whom Lord Minto, much disappointed by a pseudo-constitution
granted by the King, in which their rights
were simply disregarded, had set out for Palermo),
still remained as difficult of completion as ever. On
the 25th of March, the Sicilian Parliament met at the
last-named place, and declared the dethronement of
Ferdinand II. Thereupon ensued the bombardment
of Messina, whence arose the King’s universally-known
nickname of <em>King Bomba</em>. The independence
of Sicily was now recognised by France and England.
In May the cry of “Religion in Danger!” was raised
by the Royalist clique, and the refusal of St.
Januarius to work his annual miracle infused much
terror into the superstitious minds of the lower orders.
Unfortunately, the means successfully employed in
times past by a certain French General to induce the
Saint to perform his duty were now impracticable.</p>

<p class='c001'>By this time, a National Guard having been instituted,
the King’s position was really imperilled, and
he was in the act of preparing with his family to quit
Naples by sea, when the troops and the populace
came into collision. This, as usual, resulted in street
fighting; also, as a natural consequence, the regulars
gained the mastery, and a sad massacre ensued;
whilst to slaughter, the <em>Lazzaroni</em>, the natural adherents
of the King, added the inevitable accompaniment
of pillage. Under such circumstances did Naples
remain in a state of siege until the 15th of June.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Meantime the Sicilians had proclaimed the Duke of
Genoa their future ruler; a division of 16,000
troops, under Filangieri, was dispatched for active
service, and, after an obstinate resistance, landed at
Messina.</p>

<p class='c001'>In November the King proceeded to Gaeta, in order
to meet there Pius IX., who, by this time having lost
his popularity, had gained an equivalent by securing
the friendship of Ferdinand. Whilst there, news of
the Austrian victory at Novara reached the ears of the
two confederates, and was the cause of great rejoicing
to both; notwithstanding that, forced by popular
pressure, Ferdinand had despatched 12,000 of his
troops (he had promised 40,000) as a contingent to
the Sardinian army. This great triumph of absolutism
by no means disposed the King to alter, or even
to moderate, his style of government. Arrests and
acts of violence and brutality became continuous, and
the unhappy Liberals were unduly rewarded for their
attachment to the cause of freedom—Filippo Agresti,
Carlo Poerio, and Luigi Settembrini being arrested
and imprisoned in the dungeons of the “Vicaria,”
the most loathsome of the invariably loathsome Neapolitan
prisons.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus much have we written to show the state of
Naples at the time to which our biography appertains.
Yet this brief sketch of the position would be incomplete
did we altogether ignore the two patriots, Poerio
and Settembrini, who, not merely on account of their
notoriety as chiefs of the Liberal party, but as friends
both of Panizzi and Mr. Gladstone, call for some
especial notice in these pages.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Whoever has studied the history of Italy, more
especially the history of the country in these latter
times, will have learnt that Italian unity—the zeal
for which had, during all the centuries between King
Arduinus and Victor Emmanuel II., never become extinguished—was
not accomplished by the efforts of
any one individual. Amongst the number of those
in the highest rank who devoted their lives to the
achievement of the noble end, stand Poerio and
Settembrini.</p>

<p class='c001'>Their patriotism extended beyond the circumscription
of their native town, province, or State; they felt
that each subordinate nationality must blend with the
others, to enable their common Italy to take her due
place in the assembly of nations—to speak with undivided
voice on the affairs of Europe; to be, in fact, the
one Italy of their aspirations—strong because united.
For this, while their individual designations were still
Modenese, Neapolitans, Venetians, or what not, they
must be, over and above all, Italians.</p>

<img src='images/i_b_064.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c001'>Poerio was born at Naples in 1803. He afterwards
became a lawyer, and
for some time during the
troubled reign of Ferdinand
was, at least when at liberty,
the leader of the “Left”
in the Neapolitan Parliament.
The term “a chequered
life” might fairly be
used as expressive of such a
career; were it not that his
undertakings, having all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>same end in view, in which he was almost incessantly
engaged, and the perpetual series of arrests and imprisonments
which he suffered, imparted as it were,
a melancholy uniformity to his career. In 1831 the
crown of Italy was offered by the patriots of the
Romagno to Ferdinand II. That monarch, probably
feeling an innate disability to govern constitutionally,
or otherwise than according to the dictates of his own
will, a condition doubtless affixed to the tender, declined
the proffered gift. What he might have done had he
accepted, must remain in the realm of conjecture; his
refusal to lend his aid to the settlement of the country’s
deplorably unsettled state caused plot upon plot to
spring up on all sides. The name <em>Liberali</em> was now
first given to the opponents of the King. These
were unceasing in preaching to the people, according
to their light, the blessings of Constitutional Government.
If their skill in politics, as may reasonably be
supposed, was small, their honesty and love of country
were large; and assuredly no form which they may
have conceived, however crude, could have equalled
in weakness and depravity the various petty tyrannies
by which their country was distracted. Amongst
these <em>Liberali</em>, the most active and beyond doubt the
most able, was Carlo Poerio. It is worthy of remark
that when, in 1847, Pius IX. had achieved his
reputation as the first reformer of Italy, the only two
men of note who disbelieved in him were Poerio and
King Ferdinand II. After the breaking out of the
Sicilian Revolution on the 12th of January, 1848, at
the time he was a prisoner, Poerio’s fortunes took a
more favourable turn. Freed from his bondage, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>was made Prime Minister, and subsequently Minister
of Public Instruction. His aspirations, however,
were too modest to assume such dignity—his aim was
to be no more than a simple Member of Parliament, and
in two months he had retired from all official life. But
his days of freedom were destined to be but of short
duration. On the 19th of July, 1849, he was again
arrested, and confined in the Castel dell’ Ovo, and
from thence removed to the “Vicaria.” From this
he was on the 1st of February, 1850, taken in chains
to the Arsenal, and with Michele Pironti sent as a
common convict to Nisida.</p>

<p class='c001'>Were we to relate <em>all</em> the adventures of Poerio,
interesting and important as they are, it would be
properly considered an interpolation in our biography.
A great and melancholy portion of the story is best
told in his own words. He was asked, on his way to
the dungeons, how he was, and he answered <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Fò questa
cura di ferro da parecchi anni, e mi sento più forte</span>
(I have now been taking this iron remedy for several
years, and feel much stronger)</i>. In a future chapter we
shall have still more to say respecting this <em>martyr of
liberty</em>; but let us pass to those later years of his
life, when tardy success hardly requited such loving
patriotism, and barely compensated for his great misfortunes.
In 1859, when he came out of prison, he
was elected member for Arezzo, but steadily refused
to accept a place in the Cabinet, although much
pressed by Cavour. He died on the 28th of April,
1867.</p>

<div id='i067'  class='figleft id012'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>
<img src='images/i_b_067.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c001'>Luigi Settembrini,
though standing many
rungs of the political
ladder lower than Poerio,
was nevertheless a hardy
and enthusiastic patriot.
Mr. Gladstone wrote of
him in his letters to Lord
Aberdeen (hereafter to
be mentioned) as one <em>in a
sphere by some degrees
narrower, but with a character
quite as pure and fair</em> as Poerio’s. Settembrini
was born at Naples, the 17th of April, 1813.
His father was a lawyer, and, like his son, a patriot,
and had fought for his country in the stirring days of
1820-1. Of Luigi’s private life we may say that he
was a teacher of Italian literature and an eminent
classical scholar. In 1848 he, together with Poerio,
was tried on the trumped-up charge of being member
of a secret society. This charge was further supported
by a letter concocted by the police, so gross
and palpable a forgery that the very judges in the
case considered it more prudent to reject it as evidence.
With Poerio and forty more he was capitally
convicted. The sentence was not executed, yet he
was reserved for a fate as hard—perpetual imprisonment
<em>upon a remote sea-girt rock</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although Settembrini was in the above case most
unjustifiably, nay, iniquitously, convicted, and barbarously
punished, it is well known that he was, as a
matter of fact, an ardent supporter of the society
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>called “Giovine Italia,” an association which, had the
sagacity of its directors been more, and the audacity
of its purposes less, might have given some trouble
to the then rulers of Italy. When the King of
Naples, as has been said, charged Pius IX. with being
at the head of <em>Young Italy</em>, he probably made use of
the most scurrilous phrase, by way of accusation,
which occurred to him. The “Giovine Italia,” however,
was an established fact, albeit the association
numbered not the Pope amongst its members, nor was
it under the special protection of the Church.
Tyranny has this superiority over luckless poverty
that it renders those on whom it presses dangerous as
well as ridiculous. This peculiar form of danger, the
Secret Society, which tyranny calls into existence, is
commonly less formidable to the powers against
which it is organised than to the causes which it is
intended to protect. Had the modest programme of
the “Giovine Italia” been carried into execution, a
despotism would have been created more unbearable
than the yoke of Austria, the Vatican, and King
Bomba united. The prime object of this society was
to abolish all Princes then reigning in Italy—including,
of course, the Pope—and not only to drive the
Austrians out of the country, but the French from
Corsica and the English from Malta. When these
laudable ends had been accomplished, a great Military
Republic was to be established under a supreme
Dictator, residing at Rome, with ten consuls to govern
the ten divisions into which the whole of Italy was to
be parcelled out. Each province or division was to
be under a colonel, its Municipal Government being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>administered by a captain. To each division, subject
to the officers thereof, was to belong a treasurer, himself
also a military man. In addition to these officers
an order was to be instituted entitled “Apostoles,”
whose duty it should be to act as dictatorial or consular
agents, and to settle and arrange matters in
general.</p>

<p class='c001'>The regulations for the internal conduct of the
Society show a certain skill of organization, coupled
with a good deal of the childishness of bugbear
solemnity usually appertaining to such associations.
The following will serve as specimens of some of the
more important of these regulations:—“No meetings
of members to be allowed, and no conversation
between members more than two in number at any
one time. Oaths to be sworn on a skull and dagger.
The Republican flag to be a white skull on a black
field, and the motto <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Unità, Libertà, Indipendenza</i></span>.
The dress to be black, and the arms a musket and
bayonet, with a side dagger. Drilling to form a principal
and constant duty.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Although a Secret Society of this description is a
standing monument of folly and wickedness, yet
it is hardly possible, considering the state of things in
Italy at the time of which we write, not to feel some
compassion and make some allowance for the conspirators
of “Giovine Italia.” Their great idea—the
Unity of Italy—had been set forth by Dante according
to a poet’s conception. Macchiavelli had planned its
execution as a statesman. The love of country was
extended by the patriotic subject of the kingdom of
the Two Sicilies to every comer of his native land.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>The dream—if dream it may be called—has found its
accomplishment in reality within our own time, but
happily not by the agency nor after the ideas and programme
of “Young Italy.”</p>

<div id='i070'  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_b_070.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c001'>In the early part of 1851 Mr. Gladstone made his
memorable visit to Naples; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Si natura negat facit indignatio
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>versum</i></span>. The great statesman possessed a nature
particularly averse to revolutionary sentiments or prejudices,
and a more impartial judge betwixt King and
People never existed. Shortly after his arrival he had
“supped full of horrors,” and he longed to express
his inward feelings on the palpable absence of justice
in the actions of the Neapolitan Government, and the
cruelties practised on the persons of hapless political
offenders, many wrongfully condemned—cruelties of
which he was an unwilling and shocked witness. His
observations resulted in the two celebrated letters to
Lord Aberdeen. The general character of the administration
is well summed up in a pithy sentence
quoted in the first, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>E la negazione di Dio eretta a
sistema di governo</i></span>. (This is the negation of God
erected into a system of government.)</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Gladstone, with his usual moderation and
desire of accuracy, declines, in these letters, to decide,
and shows himself willing to give Ferdinand the
benefit of all doubt on the subject. He even records
an instance of “a direct and unceremonious appeal to
the King’s humanity, which met with a response on
his part evidently sincere.” His account of the
prisons of Naples inclines us to refer our readers to
this correspondence rather than to transfer his
description to our own pages. Suffice it to say, that
he calls them “the extreme of filth and horror,” the
Vicaria “that charnel-house,” in which, amongst
other iniquities, even proper medical assistance was
withheld from the sick prisoners.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was not long ere an answer to these statements
was attempted by the Neapolitan Government, under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>the title <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Rassegna degli Errori e delle Fallacie
pubblicate dal Sig. Gladstone</cite></span>, &amp;c, &amp;c. This
brochure evinced an ingenuity of sophistical argument,
to say the least of it, only worthy of such a
cause. Before any authorized reply to it appeared,
it had been skilfully and sufficiently answered by an
anonymous author in a pamphlet entitled:—<cite>A
Detailed Exposure of the Apology put forth by the
Neapolitan Government, in reply to the Charges of
Mr. Gladstone, under the title of Rassegna, &amp;c., &amp;c.
(1852). London</cite>. Mr. Gladstone’s own answer,
entitled, <cite>An Examination of The Official Reply of
the Neapolitan Government</cite>, was published soon
afterwards. In this the writer grants the utmost
limits of concession to his opponents; whatever rests
not on manifestly sufficient evidence, nay, on moral
certainty, he retracts: whatever even seems to require
modification, he unhesitatingly modifies; but, modification
and retraction notwithstanding, it must be
acknowledged that the case stands much as it was.
To quote the author’s own words:—“I believe that,
for my own vindication, I might without any new
publication have relied in perfect safety upon the
verdict already given by the public opinion and
announced by the press of Europe. The arrow has
shot deep into the mark, and cannot be dislodged.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Judging from a letter of Mr. Gladstone’s to
Panizzi, it may be concluded that the latter had much
to do with the publication of these famous letters:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“October 6th, 1849.</div>

<p class='c001'>“My dear Panizzi,</p>

<p class='c013'>“... You and I have, I think, been
looking with much the same feeling at what has been passing;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>in Rome. I am no great revolutionist elsewhere; but I am
persuaded that the civil Government of three millions of
people ought not to be carried on only by priests, and a real
representative system giving the community the power of the
purse, is the best, and, so far as I can see, ought to be accepted or
endured.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Cardinal Alberoni; Panizzi and Lord Shrewsbury; Correspondence
arising from Gladstone’s Visit to Naples.</i></p>

<div class='c010'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/dc_t.png' width='150' height='147' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
There now arose, mainly out of the
great subject treated by the Gladstone
letters, an important correspondence
between Panizzi and Lord Shrewsbury,
who died at Naples, Nov. 9th,
1852. In 1850, his Lordship went to reside in quiet
retirement at his villa near Palermo, from whence
he visited Switzerland, and returned in Oct., 1852,
but spent the Autumn at Rome. In politics he was
a Whig. In the Catholic Directory we read ‘that
the angelic purity of Lord Shrewsbury was the
theme of every one’s admiration, and never did he
allow a light or indelicate word, or the slightest
allusion contrary to modesty to be made before him.’
In order that the reader may rightly understand
the first few lines of this chapter, it must be
stated <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>en passant</i></span>, that Panizzi had written in
the British and Foreign Review for October, 1844,
an article on the Republic of San Marino, in
which he attempted a vindication of that brilliant
example of a self-made man and dexterous (we
may say unscrupulous) politician, Cardinal Alberoni.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Let it also be said that the dark as well as the bright
side of Alberoni’s character is therein treated with
perfect impartiality. His intention was to write
a full biography of the eminent Cardinal, and
had requested Lord Shrewsbury to procure him some
documents at Rome, as material for the work.</p>

<p class='c001'>The commencement of Lord Shrewsbury’s first
letter contains the answer to this commission:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“Palermo, April 5th, 1851.</div>

<p class='c001'>“Dear Mr. Panizzi,</p>

<p class='c013'>As a private opportunity offers for England, I take
advantage of it to say that I have by no means neglected
your commission, yet I can only say in general terms that I
have not succeeded in all your desire, for just now I cannot
lay my hand on the correspondence, but the papers are where
no one can get at them without a great deal of fuss, and
without the intervention of some influential person on the
spot, and who will undertake to examine them at the same
time; and now that Cardinal Wiseman has, to our great surprise,
left the position he was destined for, and taken up another
where we did not expect to see him, the scheme you
had so honourably intended for the vindication of an injured
Prelate, and calumniated diplomatist and statesman, must fall
to the ground for the present. Of course you have “Istoria
del Cardinale Alberoni, Seconda Edizione, &amp;c, &amp;c., Amsterdam,
1720.” This appears, by the notice of it, to be an
authentic and able defence of the Cardinal, containing four
letters written by <em>himself</em> from Sestri, <em>in reply to the accusations
brought against him</em>. If you can suggest anything I
shall be happy to attend to it, but things at Rome are so perplexed
and troublesome that it is difficult to get anyone to
take an interest in matters that do not immediately concern
their own duties. Had our friend Cardinal Wiseman remained,
the thing could have been done no doubt, but he too
has other questions to occupy him just at present....”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>The following brilliant passage in the same letter
commences the controversy between the correspondents
on the affairs of the Neapolitan Government—<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Risum
teneatis?</i></span></p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“We enjoy the peace and quiet—<em>both civil and religious</em>—of
this place amazingly: and begin to feel that we are safer
and happier under the absolutism of Ferdinand II., and the
Martial Law of our Good Prince Satriano, than under the
boasted sway of the ‘Glorious Principles!!’ For, under your
good friend Ferdinand, and his worthy representative, we are
sure of safety and protection, as long as we observe the law,
as becomes a peaceful member of society. But, under the
‘Glorious Principles‘ we violate no law, and fancy ourselves
safe, when, lo and behold, we are arraigned as criminals, and
condemned to be mulct to the last farthing by an <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ex post facto</i></span>
arrangement of the collective wisdom (?) of the freest and
most enlightened nation under the sun! But I shall shock
your sensitive nerves, and scandalize your constitutional
orthodoxy, so I must bid you good-bye, and beg of you to
believe me, dear Mr. Panizzi, your very obedient and obliged
friend and servant,</p>

<div class='c011'><span class='sc'>Shrewsbury</span>.”</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Thus Panizzi replied to the first of these passages:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“British Museum, April 24th, 1851.</div>

<p class='c001'>“My dear Lord,</p>

<p class='c013'>I have had the honour to receive, a few days ago,
your Lordship’s letter of the fifth inst., than which no letter
could have given me greater pleasure. I should have acknowledged
this honour ere this, had not the malady and subsequent
death of Lord Langdale, one of the best friends I have ever
had, taken from me the power of fulfilling even the most
agreeable duty of thanking your Lordship for the kindness in
remembering my request in reference to Alberoni, and still
more for that of addressing to me so excellent a letter as

Alberoni. From Prince Castelcicala I had already received
a message, for which I begged him to thank your Lordship,
showing that you had not forgotten the favour I had been
encouraged by your kindness to ask your Lordship. I now
beg to enclose a memorandum in Italian, stating in a few
words what I want from Rome, and why I want it, and if
a further attempt could be made I should feel obliged; if
not, we must have patience. The Emperor of Russia has
actually graciously condescended to order the copies of certain
documents in his Imperial Archives to be made out and
sent to me, and at Rome one cannot, even through the
powerful interest of your Lordship, find means of knowing
whether certain papers contain any charge against a Cardinal,
who was certainly innocent, who is calumniated in history,
and whose innocence, it is expected, would be fully established
were the contents of the papers in question known.
These are mortifying comparisons, my Lord, for us both as
Catholics, and for me, moreover, as an Italian. The schismatic
Emperor more ready to assist in proving the innocence
of a Cardinal than Rome!!! Whatever has been printed
and published respecting Alberoni I have procured, and the
letters mentioned by your Lordship were the documents
which led me first to suppose him innocent and calumniated,
a supposition which further researches have amply confirmed.</p>

<p class='c001'>I sincerely wish Cardinal Wiseman had remained at Rome,
not so much on account of the assistance which, I do not
doubt, his Eminence would have lent me in the Alberoni
affair, as, on account of the irreparable mischief that his coming
back to England has produced....”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>The reader need hardly to be reminded that the
last sentence refers to the celebrated “Papal aggression”
of 1851. Panizzi’s answer to Lord Shrewsbury’s
curious laudation of the Government of Naples
is direct and incisive:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“I am grieved, my Lord, more than I can express, at the
praises your Lordship bestows on the Government of his
Sicilian Majesty. I am grieved, because the countenance of
such a Government by so high an authority as your Lordship’s
encourages tyranny and despotism, to which two
abominations all the miseries of mankind are to be attributed.
I say <em>all</em> advisedly; for all the follies, the wickedness,
the crimes of the extreme Republicans, whom I detest
as cordially as the Neapolitan Government can do, are <em>all</em>
owing to the detestable Governments under which people
live, and by which they are driven to madness. Nations are,
to a very great extent (I am almost inclined to say altogether)
what their spiritual and temporal rulers make them; and in
the same manner that we attribute much of the unfortunate
state of Ireland to the English misgovernment of old, we must
be just and attribute the miseries of Sicily, her dissatisfaction,
her rebellious spirit, her crimes, and her cruelties to misgovernment.
It is misgovernment that makes repealers,
socialists, red republicans, &amp;c. I wish I could say that
things have improved of late in the Neapolitan Government;
but, my Lord, Europe has heard with horror of the iniquitous,
cruel, and worse than heathenish trials and condemnations
that have lately taken place against men whose innocence
is as well known and clear as daylight. I should not speak
so positively were it not that Mr. Gladstone, the member for the
Oxford University, whose talents, whose honesty, and whose sober
political principles need no praise, has just come from Naples
in such a state of indignation against the Government as I
should never have expected to see in such a man. He has
made it his business to enquire into the truth of the charges,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>into the proofs brought forward to support them, into the
character of the accusers, witnesses, and judges, into the conduct
of the Government, into the treatment of the accused,
both before and after condemnation, and he has come to the
conclusion, which he has expressed to me and to others in
these precise words, deliberately weighed and then repeated,
<em>the Government of Naples is the Government of Hell upon
earth</em>. These expressions from an English gentleman, uttered
in English, with the accent of deep religious conviction, need
no comment. Mr. Gladstone has shown me documents in
support of his conviction, and they bear him out most abundantly.
As a strong Conservative, and because he is a Conservative,
as a Christian and as a gentleman, Mr. Gladstone
(I use his own words) feels himself bound in conscience to
expose iniquities which I am horrified in thinking of. He
will do so in the House of Commons, as far as he can, but the
details are so horrible, so revolting, so indecent that he will
not be able to tell before an assembly of gentlemen the whole
truth. But what he will and can say will produce the proper
effect in Europe, not on Republicans only, but on statesmen of
Conservative principles, who feel these principles disgraced
and compromised by such abominations. No Government can
be formed in England, should the present one be forced to
make way, without Mr. Gladstone, who, in office as out of
office, will not spare the guilty. Another man of unimpeachable
character, of remarkable talents, of opposite political
principles, Sir William Molesworth, fully agrees with Mr.
Gladstone, and both say openly that they rejoice at the
majority of the House of Commons that kept Palmerston in
office last summer, when they both voted in the minority.</p>

<p class='c001'>Your Lordship is at perfect liberty to state all this; neither
Mr. Gladstone nor Sir William Molesworth shrink from the
responsibility of their statements; on the contrary, they make
them openly and unreservedly. I pledge my honour that I
do not overstate what they say; in fact, it is <span class='fss'>IMPOSSIBLE</span> to do
so. If your Lordship, however, has any doubt, just please to
write to either or both of them, and ask if I exaggerate.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>And now, my Lord, allow me for the sake of humanity,
whose cause I know no one has more at heart than your
Lordship, for the sake of good government and religion,
allow me to beseech you heartily to refrain from praising a
government like that of Naples, or rather let me entreat
your Lordship to use the powerful influence you must possess
to open the eyes of the authorities, and induce them,
for their own sake, for the sake of humanity, to behave like
Christians.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The reply to this contained in the following extract
is both in form and substance a wonderful specimen
of logical reasoning. We abstain from further comment
on it and at once insert it, lest we detract from
the enjoyment the reader must derive from its
perusal:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“Palermo, May 21st, 1851.</div>

<p class='c001'>“Dear Mr. Panizzi,</p>

<p class='c013'>I am very thankful for your kind, interesting,
though melancholy letter of the 24th ult., but which only
reached me yesterday evening, and as our post goes tomorrow,
I have but little time to say anything. But the
main question you have treated is so important and big with
all sorts of consequences, that I cannot refrain from immediately
touching on it. I translated that portion relating
to Naples, and took it to the Lord Lieutenant, who will
forthwith send it to Naples, and ask for some official document
in return. He at once, as I was sure he could with a
safe conscience, denied the truth of the main charges. That
the prisons are in a very unsatisfactory state, cannot be
denied, and is sadly to be lamented. But reforms are almost
always tedious and difficult. In what condition were the
prisons in England some fifty years ago? Yet the King is
by no means unmindful of them, and the female prisons have
been thoroughly amended. They are now in the hands of
the Jesuits and the Sisters of Charity.... But the iniquities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>of the Judicial system, as applied to State prisoners, is the
great offence.  Now, from what I had heard from Sir
William Temple myself and from others, and what I hear now
from the good Prince who rules this island, I am thoroughly
convinced that Mr. Gladstone has been deceived by false
testimony. The King’s government is the least vindictive it
is possible to conceive; before 1848 there was not one State
prisoner in Naples, and before the Revolution here, there had
not been one single capital execution for six years. So much
the worse you will say, and so say I. It was this mistaken
leniency that wrought out half of the social mischief. Remember
the trials are all public, the witnesses are examined
in public, the proceedings are published in the public papers,
and out of the thousands who have offended, very few are
arrested and tried. The proceedings are slow for the purpose
of giving, not violating justice, ... Sir W. Temple
told me all that you have now asserted on the authority
of Mr. Gladstone and Sir W. Molesworth, and he added that
of all the liberal side of the late Chamber of Deputies there
was not one who was not either an exile or a prisoner. I
was horrified at the statement, and went forthwith to a most
respectable English <em>Resident</em>, who knew Naples well: he
immediately said, ‘That is false, to my own knowledge, for I
am acquainted with several who are neither one nor the
other.’ But the truth is that Sir W. Temple is mystified,
and thus mystified others. He and Lord Napier, and all the
Consuls, and all the travelling Ministers (such as Lord
Minto) are, and have been ever in the hands of the Revolutionary
Party, and are duped by them, and I am confident
that Mr. Gladstone’s evidence will turn out of the same
quality. After all, who were the liberals’ deputies?—who
the men who infuriated the people on the 15th of May, and
overturned the Constitution? They were Red Republicans,
sworn to dethrone the Sovereign. Would they have been
better treated in Ireland than in Naples?...  The
Revolution here was nothing but a history of atrocious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>crime and atrocious tyranny—regular mob-law exercised by
a mob of armed banditti. There is no more honourable or
humane or upright a man than Filangieri, nor a more
humane and upright and honourable a Prince than his
Sovereign; but, as M. Fortunato told Baillie Cochrane, ‘the
characters of the Sovereign and his servants are sacrificed to
the calumnies spread abroad in Naples,’ by those who ought
to know better. No man reverences Liberty more than I
do, or sees, and hates the evils of despotism; but mob-law is
the greatest evil of all, and this, so far, has been the only
blessing which so-called Constitutional liberty has hitherto
brought to poor ill-fated Italy....</p>

<p class='c001'>And, at the risk of exceeding our limits of space,
Panizzi’s reply must be given in full:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“British Museum, June 4th, 1851.</div>

<p class='c001'>“My dear Lord,</p>

<p class='c013'>The day before yesterday I had the honour to
receive your Lordship’s letter of the 21st of last month. I
need not add that I am very much obliged to your Lordship
for it. As your Lordship observes, the points now the chief
subjects of our correspondence are so very important that I hope
you will forgive me if I take the liberty of freely expressing
my opinion when I am so unfortunate as to differ from your
Lordship; for on such subjects flattery, and even over-deference,
are a crime. It is the more necessary that I should,
with due respect, but freely, express my dissent, when
requisite, from your Lordship’s conclusions, as the opinion of
your Lordship, and a correct knowledge of the facts on your
part may lead to very important consequences.</p>

<p class='c001'>I need not state it especially and prominently, perhaps,
but <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ad abundantiam</i></span> I wish it to be well understood, that in
what I am going to say I mean nothing disrespectful towards
His Sicilian Majesty, whom I supposed to be moved only by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>a sincere desire of performing the duties of his high station
as a Christian Prince. I give him, therefore, credit for the
very best intentions, and I trust I am not wrong in supposing
that, far from feeling offended with those who, like myself,
strive to open his eyes to the real state of his Government
(supposing the opinions and statements of so humble a person
like myself were to be known to his Majesty), he would feel
thankful. As to the Prince of Satriano, I cannot figure to
myself a Filangieri otherwise than humane, high-minded, and
a lover of truth and justice. It is a name of which an Italian
must be proud....</p>

<p class='c001'>Your Lordship’s letter refers to three very distinct topics.
First, the conduct of the Liberals; second, that of the King
and his Government; third, that of the Courts of Law.</p>

<p class='c001'>With respect to the first point, I shall not trouble your
Lordship with many observations. If it be true that the
people had no reason to be dissatisfied; if it be true that in
Sicily, for instance, they were guilty of the atrocities laid at
their door; if the chambers of representatives were formed
out of needy lawyers and brawling demagogues, how is it,
my Lord, that the Government which has always been strong
and despotic has not produced better results? Whose fault
is it that people don’t know when they ought to be satisfied,
that when they can they are cruel, ferocious, and all that,
that needy lawyers and demagogues carry the day?...</p>

<p class='c001'>I hope, my dear Lord, that a passage in your letter is misunderstood
by me. Your Lordship seems to think that it
was owing to the leniency of the Government that the
Liberals did all the alleged mischief, and that, by shedding
of blood, better results would have been obtained. If so, I
beg to differ entirely from your Lordship. I am not one of
those squeamish sort of persons who faint at the mention of
punishment of death, even for political crimes; but assuredly
the Neapolitan Government has never been accused of weakness
on that score. I believe there have been more people
put to death in the two Sicilies for political crimes since the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>French Revolution in 1789 began than in any other country
in the world, France excepted. In Spain civil war has raged
for so many years that it is impossible to draw a comparison.
But in no part of Germany or of the North, of course not in
England, nor even in other parts of Italy, has blood been shed
more recklessly, more cruelly, or more remorselessly than in
the kingdom of the two Sicilies. And what is the result, I
ask once more? Oh, my Lord, that blood letting is a terrible
and dangerous remedy!... It is a game at which two
may play, and if Kings are too ready to put to death, they
may teach republicans the same readiness....</p>

<p class='c001'>As to the conduct of the King’s Government, I can only
say that, if there be no aristocracy in either Sicily or Naples,
it is only because it has been destroyed by the King’s Government—that
it is owing to the Government that the French
law of succession has been introduced in the kingdom of
Naples, and then in Sicily, that in those kingdoms the scandal
has been often seen repeated of the Sovereign swearing to
statutes and fundamental laws, and then breaking his oath
without fear of God or man....  This may be
kingcraft of some sort, but it is not either religion or
morality.... I hear it often said, ‘Oh, the people
are deceived and misled by demagogues, on whom they ought
not to place confidence.’ Why, on whom are they to place
confidence? The poor people, when what passes before their
eyes shows to them that those who govern them hold nothing
sacred, and that the more solemn the oath, the more explicit
the promises, the more earnest the appeals to loyalty, the
more easy the perjury, the more barefaced the quibbling, the
more gross the deception of those who relied on oaths, on
promises, and on fair words?</p>

<p class='c001'>After the 15th of May, 1848, a proclamation was published at
Naples, signed by the King only; weigh well his words as an
English gentleman, and recollect there are not two principles
of morals—one for Kings and the other for other persons, or
one for England, and one for Naples....  Well, then,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>what has been done, and <em>with what success</em>—for I am a man
of facts, and not of theories—to establish that good Government
that is to be the forerunner of the Guarantees for it?
And if the Constitutional system is impossible, why did the
King give a Constitution?...</p>

<p class='c001'>I now come to the third point. Your Lordship tells me
that Mr. Gladstone has been deceived.... You say
distinctly not only that Sir W. Temple and Sir W. Molesworth
are mistaken and have been deceived, but you hold as
undoubted that Sicilian liberals, as well as foreign Diplomatists
and Consuls, and Captains, and Admirals, and Ministers, &amp;c.,
&amp;c., all are either knaves or fools, who either wilfully or
stupidly misrepresent the truth. Well, if I had no other data
to judge of the validity of this sweeping exception than that
the bulk of the persons here mentioned are Englishmen, I
should not assent to your views. And not only many of them
are Englishmen, that is belonging to a nation, as a whole, the
most veracious on earth, but both English and Foreigners are
persons of standing, &amp;c....  On what ground is your
Lordship induced to doubt their trustworthiness? Of your
own knowledge you cannot know much. You collect your
information from persons belonging to one side only, &amp;c., &amp;c....
It is not said of all the Deputies on the liberal
side of the late Chamber “there is not one who is not either
an exile or a prisoner.” What is said is what follows: ‘Of
the whole number of deputies (160), only 140 attended
when the Chamber sat, of these 140 there are 24 in prison
and 52 in exile, that is to say, more than half.’ Let the
names of those 140 who attended be looked after, and let the
Government say where are 76 of them. If the Government
do not do so, it may be, my Lord, I shall have the painful
duty of sending a list to your Lordship myself for the
Government’s information. And in looking after deputies,
I wish you would inquire after one who was assassinated,
and also ask for a certain Peluso, a priest, who enjoys a
pension from the Government....  With respect to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>the evidence of Mr. Gladstone individually, I beg to submit
the following facts. Mr. Gladstone is a political opponent of
the Ministers, and just before leaving London for Naples last
summer, voted against Lord Palmerston on the Greek question.
He went from here as strongly impressed as your
Lordship can now be that Lord Palmerston’s policy was wrong
at Naples, and that Sir W. Temple was greatly to blame for
calumniating the Neapolitan Government. Such were Mr.
Gladstone’s feelings on arriving at Naples. To say that he
is a most scrupulously honourable man as well as one of the
most acute living Statesmen, is to say what everybody
knows. What must be stated in addition, as it is important
to the point now in discussion, is that Mr. Gladstone is
a thorough Italian Scholar, and reads as well as speaks
the language as fluently and correctly as a well educated
Italian....</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now, my Lord, I defy those who tell you that Mr. Gladstone
has been deceived to show that they have taken one-tenth
of the trouble he has taken.... And I beg also to
add that in Europe a statement of facts by Mr. Gladstone,
even unsupported, which it is far from being, will outweigh
the statements of all the judges and other officials of the
Neapolitan Court. My blood boils to have to call such
people <em>judges</em>, and such a den a Court!... I shall not
apologise for the length of this letter. It was due to
Mr. Gladstone to show that he is not likely to have been
deceived, and it was due to your Lordship to show that you
must have been deceived. I hope and trust you will not
countenance by your praises, or by an extenuation of its
faults, a Government which is a disgrace to humanity and to
Christianity....</p>

  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Nothing daunted by such strong and keen weapons
of argument, Lord Shrewsbury returns to the charge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>with a supply of counter-ammunition in the shape of
a worthless pamphlet, written by one Mr. Macfarlane,
and termed, in unconscious irony, the “Cause of
Order.”</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“Palermo, June 12th, 1851.</div>

<p class='c001'>“Dear Mr. Panizzi,</p>

<p class='c013'>I send you an interesting little <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>brochure</i></span>, which,
I trust, will serve to show that Mr. Gladstone has been mystified.
Rely upon it, the Government of Naples, whatever
imperfections it may have (and what Government is without
them?) is by no means deserving of the censures which have
been so liberally and so unjustly cast upon it by a certain
class of writers, and still more, and with far greater effect, by
a certain class of speakers and talkers.</p>

<p class='c001'>Macfarlane’s statements, in his ‘Glance at Revolutionized
Italy,’ and in his appendix, I am convinced, are by no means
too favourable. The absurd, ridiculous, superficial, and
<em>notoriously false</em> facts and figures of Mr. Whiteside will never
counteract the solid truth of the rival, and more experienced,
and far more talented tourist....”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The remainder of this letter is hardly worth quoting.
Arguments, or assertions, are repeated, and
there is much discussion on “the havoc, crime, and
plunder” of the “Glorious Revolution,” on the previous
fulness of municipal coffers and general prosperity
of the country; on the progress of all works
of commerce and agriculture, the making of new
roads and harbours, the lightness of taxation, &amp;c.
There was “no grievance except old Maio’s slack
hand over the demagogues. Had there been a Satriano
or a Pronio there had been no Revolution, nor
even a serious thought of it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The statements of the English Blue Books are stigmatised
as a mass of error and bad faith.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>The extreme prolixity of Lord Shrewsbury’s letters,
and the weariness of the “damnable iteration” in which
they abound, render it difficult, and indeed unnecessary,
to present them in their entirety. In fact, so
much of Panizzi’s portion of the correspondence, as is
set out in full, gives all that is wanted of his opponent’s
argument and of the answer to it. Lord
Shrewsbury harps much on Sicily (out of which he
comparatively rarely ventures) in his defence of the
Government of King Ferdinand. Slightly oblivious
of the fact that it is despotism that has reduced the
Southern Italians to the state in which he finds them,
he decides that such despotism should be perpetuated
as the only form of Government which suits those it
has created. To attempt to improve by absurd and
iniquitous revolution, to interfere with the well-settled
and satisfactory state of things here described by Lord
Shrewsbury, and with the benevolent régime which
had so ordered matters, would be reprehensible in the
last degree. Meanwhile nothing can exceed the contempt
with which the writer speaks of the almost too
happy people of this too happily governed Kingdom;
prefacing his notice by advising those who have
rashly maligned the King and his Government to
come over, and see and judge for themselves:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“Let any one come here and read the official documents,
and hear and see the lamentable history of a period which will
ever be a blot upon our national honour and honesty, (for we
violated every principle of international law,) he will imbibe
very different notions of both the King and the Government
which too many of us have been so unjustly and inveterately
maligning. The people of these countries are no more fit for
liberty than cats and dogs. They know not what it is, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>how to use it, nor are there materials to guarantee its due
exercise even if they understood it better. Large and free
municipal privileges, <em>such as they really have</em>, with a good
Governmental administration, and a strong hand to repress
crime, is all that they are suited for, and all that they ought
or do desire.... In the meanwhile, read Macfarlane, and
sip in wisdom and instruction from his sprightly stream....
<em>You</em> look to his facts and assertions and the authorities upon
which they rest, and believe that both you and Mr. Gladstone
and Sir W. Molesworth have all been mystified, even more so
than the readers of the Blue Books.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>No apology, we feel sure, is needed for the introduction
in this correspondence of such letters from
Mr. Gladstone as reached Panizzi during its continuance,
and bear on the subject matter. A passage in
the following epistle will remind the reader of the
contrast between revolutions in more than one foreign
country, and the manner in which such movements
have happily been hitherto dealt with in England:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“June 21st, 1851.</div>

<p class='c001'>“My dear Panizzi,</p>

<p class='c013'>You speak of the scanty justice done here to the cause of
Italy. No doubt it is true, but something must be allowed
for the imperfection of all organs contrived by men. Parliament
fails, sometimes egregiously, in its duty to England. I
have often thought it impenetrably hardened in injustice
when the question has been about some acts of our own to
Foreign Powers or countries. I am then the less surprised
that it has little time or thought for Italy, not having enough
for its own immediate duties, and of course preferring, not
perhaps without a tinge of selfishness, what lies nearest home.
I do, however, <em>most deeply</em> grieve over the silence of Parliament
about the expedition to Rome in 1849. That was a
great opportunity and should not have been missed. It was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>missed, out of a misplaced regard to democracy, the sham democracy
of France.</p>

<p class='c001'>I am, however, certain as matter of <em>fact</em> that the Italian
habit of preaching unity and nationality in preference to
showing grievance, produces a revulsion here; for if there are
two things on earth that John Bull hates, they are an abstract
proposition or idea and the Pope....</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>To speak of Lord Shrewsbury as an honourable,
high-minded man—a gentleman in the strictest sense
of the term, who honestly espoused the worse, inasmuch
as he conscientiously believed it to be the
better cause—would be almost offering an insult to
his memory. An English Roman Catholic of the
older sort, he was religiously (though perhaps unconsciously)
rather than politically biassed in favour of
the peculiar manner of Government obtaining in the
Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Many members of
that great Church to which he belonged will not
hold her disparaged by the assertion that, in her relations
to man, there are two great points which she
chiefly regards. First, that men shall always be kept
in due subjection to the powers that be in both
Church and State, and secondly that they shall, while
in that state of subjection, be rendered by their
rulers as comfortable and contented as possible under
the circumstances. A third object, which Christians
are apt to look on as of some little importance—that
men should be in mind so developed as to
deem themselves of some account, both as individuals
and as members of the State—she regards but distantly,
if at all. Considering Lord Shrewsbury’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>mental constitution, his view of the matters around
him is in no wise surprising; but let the first well-authenticated
case of anything approaching to
tyranny and oppression reach his ears, and his
humanity and indignation are at once apparent. Of
this he shall be his own witness. Nor is his feeling
of generosity lessened by the fact that, in protesting
against the treatment awarded to the unhappy
Poerio by the best of all possible governments, he accuses
the sufferer of political crimes of the deepest
dye, and brings accusations against him, the falsehood
of which the most superficial enquiry would have
demonstrated. Lord Shrewsbury confined himself
not to expressions of sympathy only; he forthwith
set himself heartily to bring what personal influence
he possessed to bear towards procuring alleviation of
the sufferings of the hapless criminal:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“Palermo, June 26th, 1851.</div>

<p class='c001'>“It was this day’s post that brought me your favour of the
4th. I cannot say how distressed I am at what you tell me
of the fate of poor Poerio, for however guilty the man may
be, his punishment is barbarous, inhuman, and unchristian.
I cannot doubt what Mr. Gladstone saw. I really had no idea
that, in these times, old habits and ways of thinking in these
matters had still prevailed in Naples, to the exclusion of those
more becoming, polite, and enlightened methods of dealing
with State criminals. Our worthy Chief Governor is not yet
returned from his tour, but I hope to see him before our next
post leaves, and shall not fail to press this point upon him;
and too happy shall I be to be able to report that the rigors
of Poerio’s confinement have been already mitigated. Though
I know full well that no man is more capable of discriminating
between truth and falsehood than Mr. Gladstone, still I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>heard so much of Poerio’s criminality as to leave no reasonable
doubt upon my mind that, whatever defects there may have
been in the evidence upon which he was convicted, there is no
question of his guilt. He was, I think, an exile for his
conduct in ’30, lived at Paris on terms of intimacy with
Mazzini, and there published several Revolutionary Pamphlets,
in fine, the whole Ministry, of which he formed a part,
Dragonetti’s, perhaps, excepted, were noted and proved
Republicans, such as Pepe and Saliceti. How, then, can
any one doubt their determination to dethrone the King by
means of the <em>Constituent</em> Assembly into which they were
determined to transform the new Chamber, in May, ’48? No
one at Naples doubted it....</p>

<div class='c011'>“June 29th.</div>

<p class='c001'>“... I have just seen our good Prince. I shall copy
those portions of your letter relating to Poerio, and will send
them to old Fortunato. But, fearing they might never reach
the King, I will also send them to our friend the Marquis del
Vasto, who has constant opportunities of seeing his Majesty....
Rely upon it, I shall do all I can ... what a pity Mr.
Gladstone had not himself gone to the King; but now I hope
he will wait to see if any good comes from this before naming
the subject in Parliament. The Prince of Satriano says you
may make what use you will of the enclosed MS.; he wishes
it to be known, and would not object even to its publication;
though, as he is preparing an elaborate work in detail, it
would perhaps be better only to show it privately, certainly to
Mr. Gladstone. I have left both open for the Prince of
Castelcicala....”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>In a letter from Mr. Gladstone to Panizzi a fair
estimate is given of Lord Shrewsbury’s letters, and
the general line of argument pursued by him.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“July 7th, 1851.</div>

<p class='c001'>“Lord Shrewsbury’s letter really comes to nothing, so far
as the issues raised by me are concerned. Meanwhile, the
time is nearly exhausted, and next week I must absolutely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>print unless I learn that something good has been <em>done</em>, which
may be an effective premise of more. It is an ugly and painful
controversy, but I cannot help it....”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>To Lord Shrewsbury’s advice contained in his
letter of the 12th of June, asking Panizzi to <em>come and
see, and judge</em> for himself, he replied, at once accepting
the invitation:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“July 14th, 1851.</div>

<p class='c001'>“... Now I am ready. I have <em>scraped</em> together £100
for the purpose. I am ready to start on the 1st of September,
and to go with your Lordship, in your presence and
with your concurrence, verify all the statements made by Mr.
Gladstone. If your Lordship and I find that they are unfounded,
I shall publish the fact to the world; if they are
well grounded, I shall respectfully beg of your Lordship to
endeavour to convince the Neapolitan Government of the injustice
of their proceedings. It is superfluous to say that this
is to be kept between your Lordship and myself entirely at
present, or else the enquiry would be nugatory, and our end,
that of discovering the truth, in justice to the Government as
well as to the victims—defeated. I wish nothing but the
truth to come out. Let us, therefore, do our best to find it
out. It is worth the trouble. I can dedicate to this the
above sum and two months—September and October....”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>To this Lord Shrewsbury replied, giving his
opinion and advice as to the most effective way of
carrying out the proposed plan, and excusing himself
from personal participation:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“July 25, 1851.</div>

<p class='c001'>“I think your best plan will be to ask an audience of the
King at once, and speak to him frankly on the matter. He
will, I doubt not, listen to you, and give you the facilities you
desire; but the <em>object</em> of your audience must not be known
beforehand, or it may be thwarted. I have only <em>one</em> acquaintance
at Naples—the Marquis del Vasto ... through him I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>think I could ensure you an audience of the King, but neither
must know the precise object. I never was presented to the
King in my life, though he has been extremely kind to us. I
could not meet you at Naples for several reasons—that it
always disagrees with me, &amp;c., &amp;c. You might open your
audience with the King as the bearer of Mr. Gladstone’s
statement, which, I should think, he would never otherwise
see. I hear it has been sent to Naples; but if only to the
Minister, the King will probably never see it. He listened
most patiently to Baillie Cochrane, and is, I have good reason
to believe, most anxious to learn the truth, which others may
be as anxious to conceal from him.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The letters of Mr. Gladstone on Panizzi’s proposed
journey must be given here:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“August 2nd, 1851.</div>

<p class='c001'>“The Prince Castelcicala has sent a letter to Lord Aberdeen;
it is not much to the purpose, but calls me a detractor
and a calumniator. I could almost wish I were.”</p>

</div>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“August 5th, 1851.</div>

<p class='c001'>“It would indeed be greatly for my interest that you should
go to Naples; your journey would lighten my responsibility,
and afford me incomparable means of self-defence against the
bold assertions with which I expect to be met.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet I can hardly in conscience recommend it to you,
without conditions—your going would attract notice—your
antecedents would be learned, and your steps watched. I
cannot think you would ever be allowed to see the interior
aspect of things with the sanction of the Government, whatever
introductions you might have and whatever influence
might be used in your favour. Certainly the case would be
different if Lord Shrewsbury were to be the examining party,
and you his unobserved, and therefore independent companion,
and, I think, that in your place I should so put it to
Lord Shrewsbury himself.... I am reading with
some spice of dissatisfaction Petruccelli’s ‘Rivoluzione di
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>Napoli.’ It certainly appears from this book that there were
a party determined that the Constitution should not work.
But the question always comes back, <em>how</em> such a party
ought to be encountered.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Lord Shrewsbury’s application, which he duly
made on Panizzi’s behalf to the Marquis del Vasto,
unhappily failed of success; the Marquis being represented
by his Lordship as a <em>good, honest courtier,
and will not meddle</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Respecting the Gladstone Pamphlet, Lord Shrewsbury
wrote:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“I see that Lord Palmerston has noticed Gladstone’s
Pamphlet, in very fine and honourable terms; still I hope
the 20,000 is a misprint for 2,000. Is it not so? If not, I
am glad the letter has been published, and sent to all the
Courts; for it is the common cause of humanity and good
Government, and even touches the honour of all crowned
heads. I have always thought Lord Palmerston an honest,
well-meaning, straightforward man—though too quick, credulous,
and domineering.... I wish Mr. Gladstone
all the credit and all the success he deserves.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>It would have been of much importance to Panizzi
to obtain the countenance and influence of Lord
Shrewsbury, both for his proposed interview with
the King and during the whole of his visit in
Naples; but his Lordship’s arrangements were incompatible
with those which the traveller was under
the necessity of making for his journey. He thus
wrote:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“B. M., August 25th, 1851.</div>

the iniquities now exposed by Mr. Gladstone, nor the cruelties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>of the prisons, and I start from this as a fact in my plans and
dreams.... If your Lordship can manage to meet
me—which I repeat ought not to be a very difficult matter
for the Earl of Shrewsbury—we might under Providence be
instrumental in alleviating an amount of human misery unparalleled
in the world.... I shall be obliged for an
early answer, as I am kept in London only by this business,
and will take no holidays till I hear that I cannot employ the
time allowed for them in a more useful manner than running
from house to house in the country here.... Gladstone’s
letters have gone through <em>ten</em> editions, and are the theme of
every conversation. <em>All</em> the press, including that part opposed
to the Minister and to Gladstone, as, for instance, the <cite>Morning
Herald</cite>, have all taken Gladstone’s side; and in <cite>The Times</cite> of
last Friday there was a letter from “our correspondent” from
Naples supporting Gladstone....”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Panizzi now applied, in view of his long proposed
visit, for permission to enter the Kingdom of Naples,
and received the following answer:—</p>

<p class='c013'>... Lord Palmerston apprehends that you have

</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Early in October Panizzi set forth on his journey.</p>

<p class='c001'>Previous to his departure, Mr. Gladstone, who, it
need hardly be said, took the deepest interest in his
self-imposed mission, supplied him with the names of
men of influence at Naples who were likely to be of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>the greatest service to him in attaining the object he
had in view; these were Mr. Fagan and Signor Lacaita
mentioned in the subjoined letters:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“Fasque, September 24th, 1851.</div>

<p class='c001'>“... I have just seen yesterday’s <cite>Times</cite>, and it seems
the Neapolitan <em>reply</em> is ready and printed. I shall trust very
much to you to aid me with matter for correcting it according
to your inquiries in Naples. The persons on whose <em>accuracy</em>
I am most disposed to rely are Mr. Fagan, at the Mission,
and Signor Lacaita.... By this day’s post I have certain
news of Poerio, from one who has seen him within a month;
he was <em>in hospital</em> and allowed to walk for an hour or two
detached from any other criminal, and carrying chains on him
which my informant tells me weigh 20 or 25 pounds....”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Another letter, also from Mr. Gladstone, may be
given, written four days before the last:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“September 20th.</div>

<p class='c001'>“I return Lord Shrewsbury’s letter. It is, I think, all
things considered, very honourable to his candour, and I
would hope you may do good through his means.... I
earnestly hope the vindication and confutation will fall into
your hands while you are <em>on the spot</em>. <em>Here</em> I shall be almost
powerless to deal with the falsified details which it will probably
produce.... I have had a good deal of interesting
correspondence about my letters. Not the most pleasant of it
is a letter from Mons. Guizot, very frank and kind, condemning
outright my publication, and fully accepting the King of
Naples, and all about him as a choice of evils. I have replied
in terms which I hope will likewise be intelligible.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi1_2'>
Panizzi being, as Lord Palmerston
stated, a British subject, would have
been perfectly safe anywhere on European
soil, saving that portion of it
occupied by the diminutive but to him
important State of Modena, yet with such extensive
range he found it impossible to suppress a patriotic
yearning for his native town, and determined to visit
it on his way southwards. The reader must now
bear in mind that we have, in order to avoid confusion,
gone back to the year 1851; whereas, in a
former chapter, treating of the British Museum and
other matters, Panizzi has been described as being at
Brescello in 1857.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fact that Francis V. in 1848, had granted an
amnesty to all political offenders, encouraged Panizzi
in his resolve. But to be perfectly certain before
proceeding he applied to the proper authorities to
know if his name was mentioned in this Act of
Amnesty, lest it might perchance have been excluded.
To this application the answer was in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>affirmative, but it was penned, not, as in common courtesy
it should have been, by the Minister himself, but
by his secretary.</p>

<p class='c001'>This example of official disrespect filled the recipient
with “righteous indignation,” and he wrote (18th of
August, 1851) to a near relative of his at Modena in
these words:—“His Excellency!!! does not condescend
to write himself; perhaps he has more to do
than Lord Russell or Lord Palmerston, both of whom
always find time to write to me on the very same
day.” Thus, notwithstanding all the assurances of
the Modenese Government he continued his journey,
not caring even to pass through his native country,
if he were likely to incur the risk of becoming an
object of displeasure and suspicion; conscious, too, that
either he himself or the authorities must have very
much changed if he were not so.</p>

<p class='c001'>On reaching Genoa he received news of a sad loss
that had befallen him in the death of his sister;
and how deeply he was affected by the intelligence
may be gleaned from the annexed letter:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“Rome, 28th October, 1851.</div>

<p class='c001'>“My dear Haywood,</p>

<p class='c013'>I have not had the courage even to write to
you, owing to the great distress of mind that I have been
suffering under since I arrived at Genoa, where I found letters
informing me incidentally, and supposing I was aware of it,
of the death of my sister, whom I hoped to see a few days
after the letters themselves reached me. The news of her
death was addressed to London, and has reached it since I
left. I felt strongly inclined to give up my journey, and return
to England at once. I could not, however, do so, for
reasons I need not trouble you with, and so here I am, very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>melancholy, and not enjoying this most wonderful place as I
otherwise should. I arrived here the night before last, and
have, of course, seen little; but I have seen St. Peter’s, and
what more could I have seen, or can I hope to see one tenth
as magnificent? Lord Shrewsbury is here, and had made arrangements
to present me to the Pope before I arrived....</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Yours, &amp;c., &amp;c.,</div>
      <div class='line in14'><span class='sc'>A. Panizzi</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>At Rome, Dr. Minzi, who was engaged in ascertaining
the origin, and devising the remedy for the fever
then prevailing there, encountered his friend Panizzi.
The latter, during his stay, was perpetually beset by
spies. On leaving, he took the precaution of engaging
the company of Minzi, and to him he imparted
the following directions:—That, were he carried off
at the frontier by police agents, he (Minzi) was to
write three letters—one to Sir William Temple, at
Naples; a second to Lord Holland, also at Naples;
and a third to Lord Shrewsbury. As a matter of
fact, he was stopped at the Neapolitan frontier; but,
after careful examination of the passport, and much
unnecessary delay, was allowed to cross. His name,
however, appeared in the so-called <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Libro Nero</cite></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>On his arrival at Naples he proceeded to Lord
Holland’s house, at the Palazzo Roccella, where he
remained during his sojourn in the place; he now
brought all his energies to bear on the acquisition of
every possible scrap of information which might further
him in his mission. Before long he received
help, and this was from Mr. Fagan,<a id='rB' /><a href='#fB' class='c015'><sup>[B]</sup></a> who, having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>been Attaché at Naples since June, 1837, was, indeed,
the only person who was able to assist Panizzi.
The help received from him was in the shape of a
letter of introduction to the Signora Parilli, which
must be allowed to tell its own story:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“Dear Mr. Panizzi,</p>

<p class='c013'>I send you word, through a friend of mine
that the Signora Parilli expects you to-morrow morning.
She does not know who you are, but introduce yourself as
the “friend of Fagan.” An aunt of Poerio is a nun, and
knows all about him.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Yours, &amp;c., &amp;c.,</div>
      <div class='line in15'><span class='sc'>George Fagan</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<div class='footnote' id='fB'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#rB'>B</a>. He knew the people and country well. In 1849 he was named Commissioner
for the settlement of British claims at Naples, and at Messina in
1851. In 1856 he was appointed Secretary of Legation to the Argentine
Confederation, and after arriving at a satisfactory conclusion with respect
to the settlement of British claims in Buenos Ayres in 1858, was appointed
Chargé d’Affaires to the Republic of Ecuador, and afterwards Minister to
Venezuela in 1865, where he died at Caracas, of yellow fever, in 1869.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Shortly afterwards, Panizzi’s interview with Ferdinand
II. took place, on which occasion he was accompanied
by Mr. Fagan. The day fixed was a Sunday, the
hour twelve at noon. At ten minutes to twelve they
arrived at the palace, “We are before our time,” said
Panizzi, “Now the first question the King will ask,
will be “Have you been to Church?” So they at
once hastened into the Church opposite (San Francesco
di Paolo), and remaining but a couple of
minutes, came forth prepared to stand before the
King and answer, with clear consciences, this expected
question, which in fact was the first the King
put to them.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was quite clear that His Majesty was fully aware,
through information obtained from spies, of all
Panizzi’s movements. He received him, however,
with the greatest courtesy, and almost before he himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>had uttered a word, allowed him to talk on the
subject of Poerio and Settembrini, and the prisons
of Naples. On this theme Panizzi descanted uninterruptedly
for full twenty minutes, when the King
rose closing the interview with the remarkable words:
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Addio, terribile Panizzi.</i></span></p>

<p class='c001'>During his stay at Lord Holland’s, the Neapolitan
Government, in order that he should take his walks
abroad with greater safety, kindly furnished him with
constant attendance, in the shape of a pair of
trusty followers or spies. It is painful to relate that
Panizzi treated their delicate and unobtrusive attention
with extremely bad taste, not to say ingratitude.
He was never weary of playing tricks on his faithful
attendants, of mischievously imposing on them;
ably supported in this evil practice by his friend, and
notably by Mr. Fagan, he made them deviate from
the path in which it was their combined duty and
pleasure to walk. Panizzi and his companions would
get in and out of cabs, in the manner of a late well-known
actor, though not with the intention of bilking
the cab-driver. On one occasion, in trying to walk
down their pursuers, they became involved in a cul-de-sac,
and turning to come out, met their suite face
to face. Pursuers and pursued burst into a hearty
reciprocal laugh, the latter passed on, and the former
fell to their place in the rear, and continued the
chase.</p>

<p class='c001'>Panizzi himself even allowed others to personate
him. For example, in one instance he gave out, for
the information of his retinue, that he was going
on a shooting excursion in the neighbourhood of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Naples. The person really bent on this errand was
Lord Holland’s physician, Dr. Chepmell, who, in the
character of Panizzi, was duly followed about the
whole day. Let us hope that these honest members
of the Police witnessed, though they had little chance
of enjoying, a good day’s sport.</p>

<p class='c001'>Like all truly great men, and in particular Henry
the Great, of France and Navarre, Panizzi, when
in the company of his friends, was devoid of all feeling
of unofficial personal dignity, and delighted, when
not seriously engaged, in little diversions as free, if
not as innocent and touching, as those indulged in by
that great monarch.</p>

<p class='c001'>On one occasion—he was by nature so physically
sensitive as (to use a common phrase) to be excessively
ticklish—Dr. Chepmell, and another intimate
friend, Signor Carafa, had got him on the floor and
were subjecting him to the titillating operation. They
were rolling him in the fire-place—his face was black
with charcoal, his clothes white with ashes—when suddenly
a servant announced the Duca di X....
who had come to pay his respects to the “Great
Pan.” All the astounded Duke could do was to stand
in the middle of the room and gaze, speechless, hat in
hand, on the unexpected and inexplicable spectacle.</p>

<p class='c001'>Meantime, leave had been obtained for Panizzi to
visit the famous <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Vicaria</i></span>. Of this he received
information from Lord Feilding, who was to accompany
him over the prison:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“November 18th, 1851.</div>

<p class='c001'>“My dear Panizzi,</p>

<p class='c013'>Will you hold yourself in readiness to accompany
me over the ‘Vicaria’ to-morrow, in case it can be managed
to obtain permission?</p>

<div class='c011'>Yours, &amp;c., &amp;c.,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class='sc'>Feilding</span>.”</div>

</div>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span></div>
<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“November 19th.</div>

<p class='c001'>“All is arranged for to-day.</p>

<div class='c011'><span class='sc'>Feilding.</span>”</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Before visiting the “Vicaria,” he was careful to
draw up a most elaborate précis of all the questions
to be asked of officials, all portions of the prison
worthy of note, and all such points of information as
should render his inspection as thorough as possible.</p>

<p class='c001'>To give, in our own words, an account of this visit
would be too long for these pages, but Panizzi, on the
following day that he inspected the prison, wrote
down a few brief observations, in conjunction with
Lord Feilding (November 20th, 1851):—</p>

<p class='c001'>“The general impression on our minds was most
unfavourable. The mixing together of criminals of
every description (homicides excepted) without distinction,
the total want of occupation for the prisoners,
with the exception of about thirty shoemakers
who worked in two cells apart, and the fact that
prisoners before trial and prisoners after trial are
huddled indiscriminately together, are facts which
speak for themselves, as to the total unfitness of the
Neapolitan prison discipline for the reformation of
the offender. A criminal, when he has undergone his
term of imprisonment here, must come out infinitely
more savage and demoralized than when he went in.
Humanity, policy, and religion call loudly for a
reform in these sinks of horror.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The following is Panizzi’s report:—“Yesterday,
Wednesday, the 19th of November, 1851, I accompanied
Lord Feilding to see the prisons of the
“Vicaria.” We got permission through Father Costa,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>a Jesuit, who came with us, with another father
whose name I never heard; the Chief Gaoler and the
Inspector of the Police went with us through the
gaol. We entered it at a quarter past two o’clock,
and left it at three minutes past four by my watch.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Near the stairs by which we entered there are
prisons looking into the quadrangle of the “Vicaria.”
As two of the judges, as we were told they were,
came downstairs to get into their carriage, the shutters
of the prison nearest the bottom of the stairs were
closed, and opened immediately after the carriage had
driven off.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Having got upstairs, we entered a small room in
which a person sat keeping some register or other,
and were immediately ushered into a smaller room,
where an inspector sat. On the table we found three
different sorts of bread—<i>i.e.</i>, common bread, bread
for the sick, and bread which is given to the prisoners
in the evening. The whole of this bread was good of
its kind; the only objection to the evening bread
might be its being heavy.</p>

<p class='c001'>“We entered the first <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Camerone dei Nobili</i></span>, which
has only one window at the end of it. It is a long,
vaulted, low room, very dull, and the atmosphere of
which I should call very bad, had we not experienced
worse. Off this room, on the left, are six
smaller rooms, communicating with the Camerone by
doors, some of them closing with railings, and others
with oak shutters. In these rooms are kept such
prisoners as can afford to pay for better accommodation—that
is a small bed, instead of the common beds
of the “Camerone.” The air of these rooms was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>better, because, by leaving the windows open, a
thorough draft was created through them. But the
air was cold and damp; there was no means of excluding
the air and cold. Except in one or two of
these rooms there was a <em>paper</em> window instead of
glass; in the other there was nothing. So that you
must either have the cold from without, or close the
enormous oak shutters, and exclude both air and
light, not only from each of these rooms themselves,
but from the Camerone, which, to a certain extent,
receives both, particularly air, from them. The
atmosphere at night, when all those windows are
closed, must be intolerable; and I am firmly persuaded
that, were it not that the shutters are opened
to try the soundness of the double row of iron bars by
which each window is secured, the inmates would be
smothered. These bars are tried five times during
the night. Of course, every time this operation takes
place, the inmates are roused from their sleep or
slumber, and whilst the shutters are open a chilling
draft must be created.</p>

<p class='c001'>“In the Camerone sleep 120 persons.</p>

<p class='c001'>“We saw no <em>kitchen</em> or <em>infirmary</em>, both being removed
to San Francesco; but in the room which was
the infirmary, and which is better than the others, we
saw a poor fellow lying down asleep, but he seemed to
me very ill, and looked like a dead person.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Of this celebrated prison the writer of these “memoirs”
is enabled, from personal observation and
knowledge, to give some account.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Vicaria</i></span>, or Castel Capuano, was originally
situated outside, but is now enclosed within the city
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>of Naples. The first building was erected by William,
the Norman, for a Royal Palace, and surrounded by
fortifications. Here the Kings of Naples successively
resided, until Ferdinand of Arragon demolished the
fortifications, thereby rendering it useless as a stronghold.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the year 1540 the Viceroy, Pedro de Toledo, rebuilt
it in its present form, and gave it the name of “Vicaria.”
The magnificent chambers (stained with many a crime)
were converted into Law Courts, the smaller rooms
were utilized as dungeons. For 310 years it remained
a so-called “Palazzo di Giustizia.” Of the peculiar
species of Justice and Law administered it is hardly
necessary to speak, except perhaps to call them by their
proper names of cruelty, chicanery, and oppression.
Nor is it surprising that during these centuries, ecclesiastical
and civil tyranny should have had equal sway
within the walls of the “Vicaria.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1848 this vast and gloomy edifice, which stands
at the end of the Strada dei Tribunali, bore, carved in
stone, in bold relief, over its one heavily barred entrance,
that badge of Italian servitude, the Austrian
double headed eagle. Near the dungeons were stationed
Swiss guards. Inside the gate, and arranged
around a circular court-yard, were the houses inhabited
by the guardians of the courts, and, in addition
to these, the residence of the executioner, whose
implements, the scaffold and gallows, and all their
appurtenances were displayed outside. Three broad
staircases led respectively to the Civil and Criminal
Courts and to the cells. As regards these, one door
afforded access to the prison reserved for nobility,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>another to that set apart for the lower orders. Over
the last was a picture of the Virgin and Child.</p>

<p class='c001'>With the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Vicaria Vecchia</i></span> had disappeared many a
secret chamber and loathsome living tomb, the remains
of Spanish barbarity. According to Celano,
4,000 human beings were at one time immured in
these dens, but in the building as it now stands there
would not be room for more than 1,500.</p>

<p class='c001'>Many famous productions have cheered the solitude
of these sombre walls. In one of these cells Antonio
Sella wrote his first essay on political economy; in
another Mattia Prete, the famous Calabrese painter,
1613-1699, was a prisoner and condemned to death.
Him, however, the Viceroy reprieved in these graceful
words: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Vita excellens in arte non debet mori.</i></span></p>

<p class='c001'>Even so late as 1859 the present writer has himself
seen the eleven wire cages, swinging between the windows
of the buildings, each containing human heads.</p>

<p class='c001'>The horrors of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Vicaria</i></span> have been fully dwelt
upon here and elsewhere; but we may mention that,
on the 22nd of November, Panizzi paid a second visit
to the prison with the view of more fully examining
certain matters which had either been omitted or
superficially surveyed during his first inspection. We
forbear, however, from entering further into the
horrible details connected with the place, which deserved
no better appellation than the one given to it
by Mr. Gladstone—a very <em>hell upon earth</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>In December Panizzi took his departure for England.
He was accompanied to the last by his never
failing followers, the spies, who had <a id='corr109.31'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='com'>come</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_109.31'><ins class='correction' title='com'>come</ins></a></span> to do him
the final kind office of seeing him on board. Signor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Lacaita, who was also present to bid him adieu, took
the liberty of asking them what they wanted and
whom they were watching? <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><em>Quel pezzo grosso</em></span> (that
big fellow), replied they, “and to see that he is
safely off.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In conclusion, an extract from a letter of Lord
Shrewsbury’s, after Panizzi’s return, may possibly be
read with interest:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“Palermo, December 28th, 1851.</div>

<p class='c001'>“Dear Mr. Panizzi,</p>

<p class='c013'>... What a blessed thing it is that the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Coup
d’Etat</i></span> answered so beautifully, and did not place you in the
dilemma of either making an immense detour, or of journeying
in the midst of those robbers and assassins, the Socialists
and <em>Rouges</em> Republicans. One sees <em>now</em> why it was that
Kossuth was so anxious to return in the Spring, and what
sort of connection our friend Palmerston has made in his
chivalrous efforts <em>in endeavouring to promote the cause of
national freedom in those nations that stood in need of it</em>!
Lamartine did not use a more revolutionary phraseology in
his first address to the French Republic, when he announced
that the Treaties of 1815 had ceased to exist, and that
France “proclaimed herself the intellectual and cordial ally
of every right, of every progress, of every legitimate developement
of the institutions of nations <em>which wish to live on the
same principle as herself</em>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Verily those two letters of Esterhazy and Battyani came
most seasonably to blow out the Kossuth Bubble, and scatter
it to the winds, shewing what an empty notion it was that
Kossuth was working for the regeneration of Hungary! I
never questioned the honesty or patriotic intentions of our
illustrious Foreign Secretary, or that he ever fancied he was
not pursuing the best and wisest policy. But it is now clear
that he and Lamartine are men of the same school, and that
<em>their</em> principles, when attempted to be carried into action
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>under untoward circumstances, and at unseasonable times,
will end in disappointment to those who profess them, and in
infinite mischief to those in whose favour they are evoked.
To no country will this apply more aptly than to that
beauteous region from which you are just returned. Her
hour is not yet come. She is wholly unfit for the change
from Absolute to Constitutional liberty. She has no materials
within herself for the new edifice. The Law of 19 in Sicily,
and the Code Napoléon in her Continental States, have so
utterly deranged the mechanism of her old feudal construction,
and uprooted the foundations on which any solid structure
could be raised, that it is as clear as it is in France that
Socialism and Red Republicanism would turn up instead of a
Limited Monarchy the moment you had set the elements at
work. Nor had Louis Napoléon a better cause to shew for
dissolving the National Assembly than had Ferdinand for
sending <em>his</em> Chamber to their homes, and stopping them in
the same wild and unprincipled career. One can only,
therefore, <em>now</em> legitimately work for her social, not for her
political regeneration. Municipal privileges are the only
liberties, a good administration of the Law is the only phase
of which she is susceptible. Any efforts you may make in
these directions may tend to good, and if you and Palmerston
will steadily pursue that object <em>only, and by means suitable to
their end</em>, you may effect much for the happiness of the people,
as well as for the security of the Throne.</p>

It was remarked of Panizzi, when in
Italy as a proof of his general unobtrusiveness
and lack of desire for distinction,
that his visiting card bore
only the simple inscription ‘Mr.
Panizzi.’ As in early years his soul had been vexed
by the mild constitutionalism of Parma and Modena,
so in riper age he showed himself perversely antagonistic,
not only to the sway of the King of Naples,
but to every Government of Europe which bore in
his eyes the slightest tinge of that especial object of
his hatred—absolutism. Yet there were some, and
amongst them one which would hardly have been
accepted by Panizzi as the most disinterested supporter
of liberty, that deemed this would-be liberator of the
oppressed, this ex-Carbonaro, this revolutionary firebrand,
worthy of notice, and even of some outward
and visible sign of distinction and esteem. It was a
real shock to his modesty when he was presented with
the cross of the Legion of Honour by the President
of the French Republic.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>Letters to Lord Rutherfurd and to Mr. Haywood,
which are subjoined, clearly show how surprised
Panizzi was at this unexpected honour:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“British Museum, Tuesday.</div>

<p class='c001'>“My dear Rutherfurd,</p>

<p class='c013'>... I am in good health and happy, but for one
thing that happened to me at Paris, where I dined at the
President’s last Saturday, and who suddenly presented me
with the Cross of Officer of the Legion of Honour! This
makes me miserable. Keep this to yourself. At Naples
things are worse than described by Mr. Gladstone.</p>

<div class='c011'>Yours, &amp;c., &amp;c., <span class='sc'>A. Panizzi</span>.”</div>

</div>

<hr class='c017' />

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“My dear Haywood,</p>

<p class='c013'>I arrived here last evening in perfect health, and
very happy to be back again. I dined on Saturday at the
President’s at Paris, who (I must tell you how annoyed I am
at it—it makes me miserable) suddenly presented me with
the Cross of Officer of the Legion of Honour! Of course I
could not say no, but hope to be forbidden accepting it.
Meanwhile it makes me unhappy.</p>

<div class='c011'>Yours, &amp;c., &amp;c., <span class='sc'>A. Panizzi</span>.”</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>A second decoration, the Royal order of “Saint
Maurice and Lazarus” of Sardinia, was presented to
him a few years later, in December, 1855, in which
year Victor Emmanuel visited London with Cavour.
Of this last honour, considering by whom it was
conferred, Panizzi may possibly have been prouder
than of his first, but, with innate modesty, he forbore
to ask the requisite permission to accept either, and
preferred to remain almost to the end of an honourable
life undecorated;—despising medals, orders, and unreal
designations which, he well knew, could not add to his
reputation.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>In the year 1851, shortly after his return to England,
there landed on these shores the bugbear of
Popery in its most appalling form, which scared the
natives of the island into a state of mind bordering on
temporary imbecility. Those who remember the Papal
Aggression<a id='rC' /><a href='#fC' class='c015'><sup>[C]</sup></a> will also, with shame, remember the
foolish fanaticism that burst forth in every quarter,
the undignified terror of many who should have known
better than to put so little confidence in their own
cause, and the extravagant and senseless rumours with
which the air was filled. To this unseemly panic Lord
John Russell’s notorious <cite>Durham Letter</cite> materially
contributed; but although there was no ground for
alarm, there was, it cannot be denied, abundance of
room for indignation. Many men of the most tried
judgment and unquestionable moderation (albeit their
voices were well nigh drowned in the general clamour),
who treated the abrogation of the ancient sees
by the Pope, and all other his <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>bruta fulmina</i></span> with
the contempt they deserved, were, nevertheless, not
disposed to sit down calmly under an insult to the
Church and people of England, aggravated by the
studied offensiveness with which it was offered.
Such as these were the last, however, to see the
necessity for, and did their best to oppose, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>construction of such a steam-engine to crack
a cockchafer as the notorious “Ecclesiastical
Titles Bill.” Happily, this clumsy machine has
been rarely, if ever, set in motion, and after some
years of useless existence has, as all know, been
finally broken up. It was impossible that Panizzi, as
a moderate Roman Catholic, should have joined in
the general outburst, or lent himself to swell the
ranks of the crew around him. But he had been
brought up in a country where the power of the
priesthood has something of reality, and wherein the
behests of the Pope are of a little more importance
than they ever have been, or ever will be, in this
realm. He was thoroughly imbued with that dislike
and horror of clericalism which those of the Latin
branch of the Church, when once they have broken
free, yea, but a little, from the more rigorous bonds
of their religion, seldom fail to show. It would be
hard, then, to judge Panizzi severely, if he seems to
have shared the alarm prevalent at the time, and to
have betrayed some dread of the consequences of the
Pope’s invasion of England. Let it be remembered,
too, that he was an Italian before he was an Englishman;
and that nothing could more effectually
have roused his ire, than the insensate conduct of
Pius IX., “the most foolish man,” as some one has
well said of him, “that ever sat in the Papal
chair.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='fC'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#rC'>C</a>. In a Consistory holden in Rome, 30th September, 1850, Pius IX. named
fourteen new cardinals, of whom four only were Italians. Amongst the ten
foreigners was Dr. Wiseman, at the time Vicar-Apostolic of the London district,
who was at the same time nominated Lord Archbishop of Westminster.
On the 27th of October following, Dr. Ullathorne was enthroned as Roman
Catholic Bishop of Birmingham, in St. Chad’s Cathedral in that town. The
same day a pastoral letter from Dr. Wiseman was read in all the Roman
Catholic chapels of his See, and on its becoming generally known that all
England had been parcelled out into Romish dioceses, the strongest <a id='corr115.n3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='indigation'>indignation</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_115.n3'><ins class='correction' title='indigation'>indignation</ins></a></span>
was expressed throughout the empire.</p>
</div>

<p class='c001'>With this apology for any seeming weakness, or
extravagance, in Panizzi’s judgment of the <em>Papal
Aggression</em>, the following letter on the subject is laid
before the reader:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“My dear Haywood,</p>

<p class='c013'>I have written Kings and Popes, and I don’t
see why what is there said does not apply to England. You
say it is a Protestant country. The United Kingdom was
Protestant before 1829, but I don’t see now how you can say
it is Protestant. As to the Church of England, I am not sure
that in point of numbers it exceeds much the Catholics, and
as the latter are eligible to all offices and places, with one or
two exceptions, as well as Protestants, I cannot understand
why the events which have happened in other countries are
not considered a precedent here. Suppose you had a Catholic
Minister here—or, indeed, suppose a Catholic Peer or Member
of Parliament was to be treated as Santa Rosa was in
Piedmont, would not that be interfering in temporal affairs?
And why should not, in the time and when the opportunity
offer, an English Catholic be treated as the Piedmontese was
for his conduct in political affairs. Of course, neither you nor
I mind being refused the Sacrament or a burial in a consecrated
place; but is it nothing that the family of a man who
is himself indifferent to it should be harassed or distressed in
this way? Is not the conduct of the Bishops at Thurles a
serious interference with the power of the State? You seem
to me to be of Roebuck’s opinion that nothing should be done,
which astonishes me in a man of practical sense as you are.
Show me a country where the interference of the Popes has
not had to be checked, except the United States of America,
and I do not suppose you are prepared, like Roebuck, to
take all the consequences of such an exceptional precedent.
Moreover, show me a country where the Pope has dared, of
his own accord alone, to upset the old diocesan partition, and
establish a new one, and appoint at once thirteen Bishops.
The agitation shown at this moment is proof enough that
the Pope and his supporters have an enormous power in this
country.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>Is England to depend on the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>bon plaisir</i></span> of the Pope
whether he will use or abuse that power? Do you think
the Pope has acted against the wish of Austria and France in
this business? Do you not see Austria giving up all the old
principles of the Emperors to the Pope, in order to propitiate
the support of the Church of Rome? Do you not see
Montalembert supporting the French President who reinstated
the Pope? Do you not see a war preparing against
the Protestant cantons in Switzerland? Do you think that
the conduct of the Pope against the King of Sardinia is
wholly from religious motives? Did Wiseman come back
from Rome by Vienna as the most direct way? I told you
before the Catholic Emancipation that you would regret your
trusting the priests, and you laughed then; that you should
laugh now is astonishing. Depend upon it, you will find
that the storm will not soon be over, and that your philosophers
will learn at their own <em>dear</em> cost what the Papal
Power is.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is not such milk and water measures that will stop the
torrent as those contemplated. England must prepare for a
struggle of greater moment and importance than any in
which she has been hitherto embarked. Keep this well in
mind; it will not be over either in your time or mine.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Probably, Panizzi, before the day of his death,
learnt to understand why the events in other countries
should not be considered a precedent in this, and how
the case of Santa Rosa would be hardly likely to occur
in the British Parliament. His underestimate in this
letter of the numerical superiority of the Anglican
body to the Roman Catholics in England is manifestly
due to his mixing up the three kingdoms together; a
confusion especially misleading in any consideration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>of the Papal Aggression, inasmuch as that movement
was not extended to Scotland (where, however, it has
a short time since been carried out peaceably and
quietly enough), and in Ireland the titles of the Romish
prelates have been always the same with those borne
by their rivals of what may be called, without offence,
the Colonial Church.</p>

<p class='c001'>More interesting, perhaps, than this letter, is another
document put forth by Panizzi on the same matter;
its length, we regret, must prevent us from offering it
to our readers; however, he recommends a curious if
not altogether original prophylactic against ecclesiastical
invasion from abroad. His remarks on the
foreign character assumed by an Englishman who
takes Roman orders, and of the allegiance (it can
hardly be called divided) by which he thereby becomes
bound are remarkable. The remedy which he proposes
for ecclesiastical defection from patriotism would
be, if carried thoroughly into effect, a little too drastic;
and, if used short of thoroughly, might work a little
more to the disadvantage of those who applied it than
of those on whom it should be inflicted.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has been thought best, at the risk of interrupting
the proper sequence in order of time of this history,
to continue and finish in this place the account of
Panizzi’s connection with and views on the Ecclesiastical
questions which sprang up at home and abroad
in his time. For this purpose a few years must be
skipped, and the reader referred to the year 1854.
Perhaps some apology should be offered for the introduction
here of a correspondence in that year on
Serjeant (afterwards Justice) Shee’s Bill on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>Temporalities of the Irish Church, inasmuch as that
Bill obtained but little notoriety at the time, and the
Serjeant’s proposed reforms were never carried into
effect by legislation. But the following letters bear
witness to the variety of questions on which Panizzi
was habitually consulted, and the frequency with
which his opinions were sought by his friends and
acquaintances, and it may be interesting to some to
know what judgment he may have formed upon a
point relating to the much vexed question of Irish
Church property, a question which even yet remains
to be thoroughly solved. Moreover, to those who
knew Justice Shee, the tone of the letter first quoted
may serve to recall the unaffected modesty and simplicity
which distinguished the character of him who
may truly be called one of the best of men:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“Serjeants’ Inn, May 31st, 1854.</div>

<p class='c001'>“Dear Mr. Panizzi,</p>

<p class='c013'>Our conversation yesterday made me think that
I might be, what I have always wished to be, useful in mitigating
the evils which we regretted.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have on the Order Book a Notice of a Motion for leave to
bring in ‘A Bill to alter and amend the laws relating to the
Temporalities of the Irish Church, and to increase the means
of religious instruction and Church accommodation for Her
Majesty’s subjects in Ireland.’</p>

<p class='c001'>If I had not good grounds for knowing that it would give
satisfaction to those whose just discontent at the existing
state of things in Ireland is a material element in the weakness
and the difficulty of all liberal Government, I would not propose
it.</p>

<p class='c001'>But I believe it would not only be acceptable to the Irish
Catholic Church and people, but a durable and easily defensible,
because a just and reasonable, settlement.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>My notion of doing good with it is—by influencing public
opinion in its favour—and my object would be in a great degree
gained if, after a temperate explanation of my Bill from
me, the Government would allow it to be read a first time as
a thing not unworthy of consideration.</p>

<p class='c001'>Will you oblige me by reading it?</p>

<p class='c001'>And if you think it is of a nature to induce any friend of
yours to change his opinion as to the unreasonableness of

</div>

<p class='c001'>“My dear Sir,</p>

<p class='c013'>I have read with the utmost attention the draft of
Bill which accompanied your letter of yesterday. The subject
is as important as it is difficult, and it is with the utmost
diffidence that I venture to express an opinion on the practicability
of your suggestions. I am afraid that any equitable
proposal like yours would be resolutely resisted by the Church
of England, not so much for what you propose doing now, but
for the sake of the precedent you would establish. On the
other hand, that section of the Catholics which is the most
violent and noisy, and, therefore, I fear, the most influential
in Ireland, would not be satisfied with the arrangement you
propose, but would look upon it as the thin edge of the wedge,
and an instalment only of what they think due to them.</p>

<p class='c001'>I am afraid that the question of the Temporalities of the
Church of Ireland is of such a nature that no moderate man
can hope to settle it to the satisfaction of both parties, so long
as either possesses any thing. The only way of settling it
would be to take every farthing of property from them all, and
paying them all alike; but this is what can never be done
without a revolution.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>There is a friend of mine to whom I should like to show
your draft of Bill, and beg, therefore, to keep it two or three
days for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the present state of public affairs, even if the Government
were disposed to entertain the principle of your Bill (and
this is supposing a great deal), I am afraid the Ministers will
not consent to its being introduced during this session. Of
this, however, I am even a worse judge than of the rest.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Lord John Russell’s opinion of the Bill was expressed
no less decidedly, though a little more curtly
than Panizzi’s:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“June 10th, 1854.</div>

<p class='c001'>“I think, as you do, that the Serjeant’s Bill would have no
chance in Parliament.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>On the 18th of August, 1855, a Concordat between
the Courts of Austria and Rome was signed. This
compact, by which a great deal of the liberty of the
Austrian Church was given up to the Papacy, caused
much dissatisfaction. In 1868, it was virtually abolished
by the Legislatures of Austria and Hungary.
To none was it more distasteful than to Panizzi, in
whom, as will have been already seen, there was a
wholesome dread of the Roman Church (a dread not
altogether unreasonable, when certain countries and
Governments had to be taken into account), and this
was strongly expressed in two letters from him to
Mr. Gladstone and to Mr. Haywood respectively.
In the last of these, it must be granted that Panizzi
very accurately estimates the opposition likely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>to be offered by disunited Sceptics and Freethinkers,
void of combativeness and enthusiasm, to the disciplined
forces of the Pope and the Curia.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“B. M., June 1st, 1855.</div>

<p class='c001'>“My dear Sir,</p>

<p class='c013'>... First of all, any Government
agreeing to a Concordat on the ground discussed, the Civil
Power is not paramount, but subject to the superior power of
Rome. When Napoleon became King of Italy, he thought it
right to ask the approval and confirmation of the sale of the
Church property, by the Pope. It was at once granted; but
when afterwards the State was going to dispose of one hundred
millions of francs more of that property, the Pope protested,
and argued that Napoleon himself, by asking the Papal
sanction for past sales, acknowledged that no sale could be
lawful without the consent of Rome.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the second place, the Court of Rome makes a great distinction
between a Treaty and a Concordat. The latter she
looks upon, properly speaking, as a boon granted by the Head
of the Church, to any inferior Civil Power who humbly sues
for the favour.</p>

<p class='c001'>I enclose you the first article of one of the most recent acts
of this kind—the very one, in fact, which the Papal Court
complains to have been broken by the Sardinian Government,
by the Siccardi Law. In the third place, the Court of Rome
does not consider herself bound to observe Concordats on her
side.</p>

<p class='c001'>First of all the general maxim of the Comitia is alleged,
that <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘non juramenta sed perjuria potius dicenda sunt quæ
contra utilitatem Ecclesiasticam attentantur.’</span></p>

<p class='c001'>As the Church is the judge of the <em>utility</em>, being the highest
power, they say, no oath or promise can be binding if against
Ecclesiastical utility. Next in the matter of Concordats, the
doctrine is explicitly taught that the Pope has the power to
derogate to them.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>I give you extracts from the works of a great Canonist, who
states the pretensions of Rome to confute them; that, however,
is another point: the point is what they at Rome
affirm.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now for the extracts. The first Article of the Convention
between Gregory XVI. and Charles Albert, dated March 27th,
1841, runs thus:—<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">‘Avuto riguardo alle circostanze de’Tempi,
alle necessità delle private amministrazione della guistizia, ed
alla mancanza de’mezzi corrispondenti dei Tribunali Vescovili,
la Santa Sede non farà, difficoltà che i magistrati laici giudichino
gli Ecclesiastici per tutti i reati che hanno la qualificazione di
crimini.’</span> <i>Ergo</i>, the Santa Sede <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">‘può fare difficoltà’</span> if she
chooses, and the Civil power by asking to be allowed to try a
priest guilty of murder, for instance, acknowledges the right of
the Holy See: <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Ergo, in altre circostanze</i></span>, that same Santa
Sede can make <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>difficoltà</i></span>. You need not my saying more.
The Canonist who stated the doctrines of Rome on Concordat
to refute them, is Schmidt (Anton), Professor of Canon Law
at Heidelberg, in the last century, whose words are as
follows:—</p>

<p class='c001'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘I.—Summum Pontificem Concordatis cum Natione germ,

<p class='c001'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">(Thesaurus Juris Ecclesiastici sive Dissertationes Selectæ,
&amp;c., vol. 1, p. 339). Such doctrines ought to be known.
Many Canonists, Catholics, have differed from them. I have
never heard them condemned or disavowed at Rome; on the
contrary, taught in the Universities in the Papal States.</span></p>

to Rome; but Philosophy, and Scepticism, and Infidelity,

No sooner had Panizzi arrived in London
than he began devising means of escape
from the dungeons of the Neapolitan
Government for his unhappy
friends. His first efforts were for the
deliverance of Settembrini, in captivity at San Stefano,
the relief of Poerio, more closely watched in an inland
prison, being of secondary consideration. That the
work was both arduous and hazardous may be conceived,
and that as yet no very palpable improvement
in the state of Naples had resulted, notwithstanding
Panizzi’s exertions during his visit, may be gathered
from a letter by Sir William Temple:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>‘There is no appearance of any change in the police here,
as the trial for the affair of the 15th May is conducted in a
more illegal way than that of Poerio. The judge puts words
into the witnesses’ mouths, or, at least, reads them their former
depositions, and threatens them with punishment if they do
not adhere to them.’</p>

<div class='c011'>‘Naples, January 15th, 1852.’</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>On the subject of poor Settembrini and his family,
Panizzi wrote in these terms to Mr. Haywood:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“B. M., March 20th, 1852.</div>

<p class='c001'>“You may recollect the name of Settembrini among those
of the persons condemned to death, and then to an <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Ergastolo</i></span>
for life, of whom Gladstone spoke in his publications, and I
myself more at length in my article in the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>,
in which I inserted the letter which he (Settembrini) wrote to
his wife whilst the judges were deliberating on his fate.
When at Naples, I became acquainted with Settembrini’s
wife and his two children—a boy and a girl. The persecutions
to which that poor woman and those children have been
subjected are incredible. Among other things, no teacher
dared give instruction to the boy for fear of losing the permission
which every teacher must obtain from the Government
to be allowed to follow his profession.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>On February 21st, 1852, Lord Shrewsbury wrote
to Panizzi:—“We were glad to hear of your safe
return, and sincerely trust your visit to Italy will not
pass without its fruit, both at home and abroad, by
removing some English prejudices in favour of the
Revolutionary party, and by aiding in the expected reform
of the Prison discipline and Police Government at
Naples.” On both these points, and more especially
the first, his Lordship may be pardoned for having
been somewhat sanguine.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was but little need for Panizzi to seek the
aid and support of Mr. Gladstone in his present
plans. On his co-operation he could ever count,
even without asking; nor was the continued maintenance
of that tyranny and injustice, which he had
so distinguished himself by denouncing, likely to
diminish the great statesman’s sympathy for its
victims.</p>

<p class='c013'>I have read Poerio’s letter with horror, but also with
admiration. The last, however does not lessen, it enhances,

</div>

<p class='c001'>From the year 1852 to 1858, inclusive, many letters,
notwithstanding the numerous difficulties in transmission,
had passed between Settembrini and Panizzi.
The former’s letters were consigned through his wife to
Sir W. Temple, and by him forwarded to England.
Of the replies, unfortunately none have reached us.
They were directed to Mr. Fagan, who delivered them
to Madame Settembrini. She had them copied in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>very small characters, in invisible ink expressly prepared
for the purpose. Various devices were resorted
to for introducing these letters into the prison. At
one time they would be hidden in linen or hemp, sent
to the prisoners, that they might occupy their time in
weaving; at others they would be sewn into the soles
of the sailors’ shoes, and a multitude of other modes
of concealment was resorted to. It is satisfactory to relate
that the ingenuity bestowed on their safe delivery
was amply repaid by success, and that the officials of
this contraband post-office escaped discovery.</p>

<p class='c001'>Settembrini’s portion of this correspondence is in
itself so interesting, and contains so much matter of
value affecting this narrative, that it has been thought
fit to give somewhat copious extracts from it. By the
following it would appear that the prison of S. Stefano
was no very desirable exchange for the dungeons of
the “Vicaria,” and, moreover, afforded no great encouragement
to any hope or plot for escape:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“S. S., November 27th, 1852.</div>

<p class='c001'>“... I am at present in a <em>real</em> dungeon. Neither
I nor any of the prisoners are permitted to descend from the
floor to which each of them is assigned. I remain as much as
possible in my own cell, or rather den, to avoid coming in contact
with desperate characters. I never see a human face, and can
only at times catch a glimpse of the sky that is over the prison
yard. Only when the marine courier arrives, am I allowed to
come down and see him, assist at the examination of my
effects, and receive my letters, returning immediately to my
cell. Under these circumstances, you can understand how
every plan becomes impossible. Time and my own sense of
honour may guide me, under altered circumstances, but for
the present I can do naught else but suffer, and suffer in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>silence. Meanwhile, I trust God will have mercy on me, for
at times I feel my spirits dying within me, and fear, if ever I
leave this place alive, I shall come out mentally and morally
degraded.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The extract next in order shows that, however close
his prison, he was fortunate enough to be able to
avail himself, notwithstanding great obstacles, of the
advantages of that scholarship for which he was so
distinguished. His selection of his author also
deserves a word of praise. After speaking of his son
Raffaele, he says:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“S. S., Feb. 16th 1854.</div>

<p class='c001'>“I present you with another production of mine, in the shape

wholly unworthy, I shall hope to complete the work, leaving

should like to mention the benefactors of my family, Lord and
Lady Holland, Sir William Temple, and you, my dear Sir.
Should it not please you, I shall simply destroy it. Labouring
under immense difficulties, without books or assistance of any
kind; writing in a room of Cyclopean horrors, on the deal
boards of my bed, distracted by the hammering of a cobbler
next to me, I am indeed unable to offer anything of genuine
worth, such genius as I may have possessed being dead within
me; but as an Italian, and a man of letters, you will judge my
work, understand my intentions, and tell me truly whether you
deem it worthy of presentation to my noble friends and yourself.
Do not be surprised at my coming forward, in this age
of noise and turmoil, with a translation from the Greek. In
my present state I am so far removed from this actual world
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>that, in order to bear my life, I take my thoughts back to
antiquity, where, with my Lucian, I can smile at mankind
and at all things past and present. Be indulgent, I pray, and
believe only in the sincerity of my intentions.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In the middle of the year 1855 Panizzi had sufficiently
matured his plan of action to be able to enter
definitely on the execution of his great design. He
had been hitherto much hampered by the difficulties
of obtaining sufficient money to make a beginning of the
enterprise. If this could be accomplished in time,
he arranged to start for Italy himself in July of the
same year. Although the main purpose of his
journey was undoubtedly the deliverance of Settembrini
and his fellow-captives, he thought it best to
keep this purpose as far as possible concealed. An
opportunity, however, had occurred, whereby he
might probably combine the business of his office
with the pleasure of succouring his unfortunate
friends. On the 25th of July he applied to the
Trustees of the British Museum for an extra month’s
leave of absence, at the same time informing them
that a circumstance had lately come to his knowledge
whereof advantage might be taken to render a
portion of his vacation useful to the Library; this
referred to the then impending sale of books belonging
to Filippo Senesi of Perugia. An extract from
a letter to Sir James Lacaita, shows something of
the embarrassments under which Panizzi was
labouring for want of sufficient funds for his undertaking:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“B. M., 26th July.</div>

<p class='c001'>“... The escape seems most feasible in company with
an English friend. I shall direct it myself in person. No
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>danger for us. What I require is money. I have £300 of
L—--; to this I shall add £100 of my own, which I shall
borrow. I want £800 at least. I must see Gladstone to-day.
I know not what he means to do. Do all you can at Edinbro’
to find me money.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>This obstacle, however, was happily overcome, and
on the 3rd of August, he thus wrote to Lacaita:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“The affair promises well, and the difficulties are enormous,
but as I have found money beyond what I had hoped, I am of
good courage. There is no danger of being defrauded, for I
pay no one now; but there is a possibility of being betrayed.
The sum needed is enormous, and is required for the chartering
of a steamer, which is to be found. Time presses. Mr.
Gladstone has behaved wonderfully, or properly speaking
Mrs. Gladstone, who has given me £100 of her own, and
found £200 more amongst her friends.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Panizzi being now well on his way southward, it is
necessary to leave him for the present, in order to
give a short account of an incident at Naples, most
conspicuous perhaps for its effect on European politics,
or on the relations between England and the kingdom
of the Two Sicilies, in which it created a passing
disturbance. It appears to have been about this time
a deeply-rooted idea in the Neapolitan official mind,
that the real and actual disasters, mostly self-inflicted,
which the English had suffered in the Crimea, joined
to the ill-success which the lively Neapolitan imagination
represented as continuously occurring to the
British arms, had reduced England almost to the level
of Naples. The time, it was thought, had come when
this once great Power, the abettor of contumacious
subjects against their rightful sovereigns, the upholder
of sedition and rebellion against legitimate authority,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>might be insulted with impunity, and a long-standing
grudge might be satisfied. Nor was the opportunity
for indulging this patriotic feeling wanting. In August
1855, Mad<sup>me.</sup> Parepa, a singer, who had married a
Maltese gentleman, and thereby become a British
subject, was very anxious to obtain a benefit-night
at the <em>San Carlo</em>, at Naples. She had been recommended
to Sir William Temple, who had a short time
before obtained a promise in her favour from the Duke
Satriano, Tito, “Superintendent of the Theatres.” Of
this promise Sir William requested his Attaché, Mr.
Fagan, to remind the Duke; he accordingly called
one evening on his Grace at his box in the theatre, so-termed
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Il Fondo</i></span>, and delivered the message. As he
was leaving he became aware of the presence of an
agent of police, apparently on duty, with evil intentions,
as was indeed the fact. This man was one
Vignati, who had been sent by the Minister of Police,
Mazza, with a message threatening the Duke with
imprisonment and other dire consequences for having
received a member of the British Legation with so
much civility. The message delivered by the man
was overheard by some one in the theatre; Mazza
himself was also heard saying, in a loud voice, “I
shall not allow myself to be imposed upon by England,
now a fourth-class Power!”</p>

<p class='c001'>This Caligula, still living and well-known to the
biographer, was as notable in his younger days for the
energy with which he exercised his office as for the
suavity of his manner in executing his intentions. It
is recorded of him that, amongst other arbitrary proceedings,
he, on one occasion, sent for Signor Niccolini
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>(now of the National Museum, Naples) and loaded
him with abuse for presuming to wear a beard. Disregarding
the advice to hold his tongue, given him by
a bystander, Niccolini boldly answered the Minister
that if the growing of beards was illegal he ought at
least to publish an order prohibiting it. <em>No, no</em>, said
Mazza, <em>no publishing of orders for me, to be held up
to ridicule by Piedmontese newspapers. You go and
cut off your beard, and see you keep clear of conspiracies!</em>
On another occasion at Catanzaro, in an excess
of temper, he went so far as to break his cook’s
arm.</p>

<p class='c001'>The occurrence at the theatre was communicated
that same evening to Sir William Temple, who lost
no time in sending a note of remonstrance to the
Minister for Foreign Affairs. That functionary,
however, seemed in no hurry, either to make apology
or give redress for the insult that had been offered to
the British Mission. However insignificant and
unworthy of resentment Naples might be, however
small in comparison with England, the insolence was
too great to be passed over. The matter was at once
reported to the Government at home, and communicated
by Mr. Fagan to Panizzi, who answered as
follows.—(August 22nd, 1855.)—“I am delighted to
hear directly from you what I have already heard
and considered incredible.  Lord Palmerston will
not, I presume, overlook this affair....”
Nor was Panizzi mistaken. Lord Palmerston’s action
in the matter was, as might be supposed, prompt and
decisive:—</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span></div>
<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“Piccadilly, August 25th, 1855.</div>

<p class='c001'>“My dear William,</p>

<p class='c013'>... King Bomba’s insult to England,
through the British Mission at Naples, must be properly
atoned for. Clarendon being at Paris, nothing can be decided
till he returns, and the Cabinet can be assembled. But I have
written to Clarendon to say that my opinion is that we ought
to insist upon the immediate dismissal of Mazza, and upon a
promise that he shall never again be employed in any public
capacity. I would not make this demand till our reserve
squadron, now in attendance on the Queen, but which will
return with her on Tuesday, and which consists of three line-of-battle
ships, shall have anchored in the Bay of Naples,
opposite the King’s Palace, and shall have taken on board the
Mission and the Consul, and then I would have a boat sent on
shore, with a demand that in two hours an answer should be
sent by the King, saying that Mazza was dismissed, allowing
half an hour for the letter to go, half an hour for the answer
to come back, and a whole hour for writing the answer. If
the time passed without a satisfactory reply, the palace should
share the fate of Sweaborg<a id='rD' /><a href='#fD' class='c015'><sup>[D]</sup></a> (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>e poi dopo</i></span>), if that should not

  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>That Ferdinand II. was extremely loth to dismiss
Mazza may be gathered from his delay in making up
his mind to do so. The case, however, was urgent,
and, pressed by his son Francis to hesitate no longer,
inasmuch as the Minister was aware of his impending
fate, the King removed Mazza from his office, and
issued a decree<a id='rE' /><a href='#fE' class='c015'><sup>[E]</sup></a> stating that he had been called to

</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>Amid all this turmoil and confusion in the Government
of Naples—this system of continuous oppression—there
was one person who, notwithstanding all
his misdeeds, may fairly claim some little share of
our commiseration—the King himself. On the evidence
of Mr. Gladstone and others, it is clear that
Ferdinand was not wholly without his good traits of
character. He was not devoid of a certain amount of
intelligence.</p>

<p class='c001'>Tyranny and slavery, however, exercise a doubly evil
influence, and harm the despot as much as the victim,
the owner as the slave. At the time of the Mazza case,
his Majesty, taught by experience, had arrived at that
wholesome judgment of persons and things which trusts
nobody and nothing. He had long ceased to put confidence
even in his own Ministers; political matters he
directed himself, and himself wrote all the more important
political despatches, many of which display considerable
acumen. It would not, indeed, be unfair to
impute a portion of his faults to the peculiar character
of his subjects, of whom he was wont to say that they
differed so much from, and were so greatly inferior to,
any other people of the Peninsula, that he alone could
govern them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile, Panizzi’s arrangements for the deliverance
of the prisoners of San Stefano had been gradually
and surely progressing, and to all appearance
hopefully. He had communicated to Settembrini
the manner in which he proposed to make the
attempt, and from him received the following
letter:—</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span></div>
<div class='quote'>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Santo Stefano,</div>
      <div class='line in10'>August 31st, 1855.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>“As a precaution I write this letter with invisible ink,
which will be made legible before it is forwarded to you.
For the same reason, and in the same way, your letters of the
30th and 31st July have been sent to me. I cannot tell you
what I felt on reading them. You are a man who surpasses
every expectation. We dared not hope for a steamer;
now you offer us one, it is all that we could desire. From
your letter it appears that the steamer will not start from
Naples, as I had expected. This matters little to us, but
it is most important that it should be known in Naples not
less than twelve days before. Communication with this place
is neither easy nor frequent, and we must know the date fixed
upon at least four days in advance, as there are certain indispensable
preparations to be made. Now the time it will
necessarily take for this letter to reach you, and for you to
come to a determination and give Madame Louison (Settembrini),
through some person, twelve days’ notice, will bring
us to the month of October, which will be more suitable, as
the cold weather and rains will then have set in, moreover the
nights will be longer.</p>

<p class='c001'>In short we are ready, only requiring four days’ notice, but
the date fixed upon must be known in Naples twelve days
before. In deciding upon the day, however, care should be
taken that there be little or no moon during the early hours
of the night, and, therefore, it seems to me that we ought to
choose some time between the 6th and 18th of October, and,
if it could be the night preceding a holiday, so much the
better.</p>

<p class='c001'>We shall, therefore, wait to be informed on what day the
steamer will pass, and what will be the signals. We are on
the upper floor of the building where there are some small
windows which look to westward; in the remainder of the
building there are only small apertures and loop-holes which
are almost invisible. The third window, commencing from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>the north, is ours; and from this window we have a view of
the whole space between Ponza and Capo Circello. The
steamer should carry a conspicuous signal as our telescopes
are not very good. She ought to find herself at 4.30 or 5
o’clock two miles from the northern extremity of Ventotene,
and then, if it is thought necessary, unfurl a sail to enable us
to see and recognize her. Then, if she passes to the east,
there will be sufficient time and light to see the wall with an
archway, almost immediately below which, on the shore, is a
small creek where the boat will have to wait, and where we
intend to be at 2 o’clock a.m. When the steamer has lost
sight of the small windows she will proceed eastward, bearing
to the south, as if making for Messina. During the night she
can return from S.S.E. as I have written in another letter, but
must not come too near Santo Stefano, and thence she would
put out the boat. When we reach the archway, we will make
a signal with a lantern, which we will repeat on reaching the
sea. If a password is necessary, we might say, <em>God help us</em>,
and may God truly help us, and lead me with my companions
to a place of safety; I trust I shall not have to write to you
again. Keep well.</p>

<p class='c001'>P.S.—If it should be stormy on the day fixed, the steamer
could come, without any signals, on the following day or the
first fine one, for we shall commence operations the moment
we know the date, and complete them on seeing the steamer;
and if a storm should rise while the boat is waiting in the
above-mentioned creek, obliging it to put off from the shore,
it must make a great effort to return, and throw us a rope
which we can lay hold of. It is necessary to foresee what is
likely to take place.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Not long after the date of this letter, Panizzi sent
to Mr. Fagan a summary of his plan of rescue, containing
all the details of the work, and the mode in
which he proposed to carry it out. This ran as
follows:—</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span></div>
<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“Genoa, 31st August, 1855.</div>

<p class='c001'>“1.—In the last days of September and beginning
of October, a steamer will pass to the eastward of the
Convent (<i>i.e.</i>, the prison), where are the birds (prisoners),
having one white streamer flying from each
mast, or from one mast, which streamer will be
hauled down for some moments, and then hoisted
again when it is at its nearest point to the island.</p>

<p class='c001'>“2.—The steamer will proceed on her course and
run out of sight.</p>

<p class='c001'>“3.—On the night of that day she will return, and
approach the Convent as nearly as she can with safety,
without chance of discovery.</p>

<p class='c001'>“4.—At midnight she will send her boats to the
island, and they will proceed towards the place already
fixed upon in the plan.</p>

<p class='c001'>“5.—The boats will not touch the shore, but will
wait off till a light is shown from the beach, when
they will approach within hail.</p>

<p class='c001'>“6.—The password from the Nuns is the name of
the friend of Louison (<i>i.e.</i>, <em>Panizzi</em>).</p>

<p class='c001'>“7.—The password from the boat will be the name
of Louison’s father (<i>i.e.</i>, <em>Luigi</em>).</p>

<p class='c001'>“8.—If the Nuns be prevented coming to the beach
between twelve and four o’clock that night,
the steamer will put to sea, and return again at the
same hour, and the same process will be repeated.</p>

<p class='c001'>“9.—If the second attempt fails, the matter must
be deferred.</p>

<p class='c001'>“10.—If the steamer does not appear, it is because
difficulties have prevented it.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>“Now if Madame Settembrini has a short memory,
it will be best to commit these points to writing, and
enclose them in a wax pill covered with gutta-percha
(a piece of which is enclosed), and which she will put in
her mouth and swallow, if examined closely at the Convent.
But better still if there be nothing in writing.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The plan set forth met with the fullest approbation
from Mr. Fagan; he, however, wrote to Panizzi “to
be most cautious, for although Mazza had left the
Police, <em>they</em>, the English, were watched night and day,
and were hated by the King’s partisans.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The great difficulty in the undertaking turned out
to be the obtaining of a vessel. Owing to the exigencies
of the Crimean War, Panizzi, up to the 31st
of August, had been unable either to charter or buy a
craft suitable for his purpose. At length the desired
object was attained in the shape of the screw steamer
“Isle of Thanet.” But now comes the melancholy
part of the story; failure of skilfully and anxiously
concerted plans, waste of money collected with so
much pain, arduous and continuous labour miserably
thrown away; bitter disappointment to Panizzi, and
prolonged incarceration of the wretched inmates of
S. Stefano. The ill-fated vessel charged with the restoration
to freedom of Settembrini and his companions
was but laden, after all, with the destruction of the
hopes of all concerned in the attempted liberation.
Scarcely had she started from Hull, when she met
with a disabling accident which forced her to put back
for repairs. These being completed, she set forth a
second time, and had proceeded no further than Yarmouth
when she was caught in a storm on the 25th
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>of October and totally lost. So ended by no default
of skill, but by the merest caprice of fortune, an enterprise
which, if we consider the persons engaged, the
means within their reach, and the purity of its purpose,
must ever be reckoned as a most brilliant attempt;
and so did not end, at least with all true lovers
of freedom and humanity, the glory of those that had
embarked upon it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Amongst others who felt the disappointment of the
failure almost as keenly as Panizzi himself was Mr.
Gladstone, who lost no time in writing a letter of condolence
on the ill-success of the expedition:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“Hawarden, Chester, November 6th, 1855.</div>

<p class='c001'>“My dear Panizzi,</p>

<p class='c013'>I cannot help writing you a line, however barren
of condolence. I had hoped it might please God that your
benevolent plan should succeed. It seems usually so hopeless
to do good in this world, on a large scale, that one desires to
become intensely concentrated on what lies within a small
compass. For myself, too, I feel that with respect to the
Italians I have had a great deal more credit than I have fairly
earned; and I wished to have a hand in <em>doing</em> something by
way of a step towards rectifying the account. I am so little
informed of the reasons and particulars of your mode of proceeding,
that I will at present go no further; but whenever
the opportunity offers, I shall be most desirous to converse
with you. I hope to hear more in the interval if you have
more that can be usefully said.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have resumed, during this recess, some old studies on
Homer, and have also gone back for collateral illustration to
that field of which I am very fond—the Italian romance. So
for the first time I have been reading you on Ariosto and
Bojardo, and on the romance in general; let me add, with
great interest and pleasure, and with profit too, unless it be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>my own fault. But I am curious to know whether you still
hold all the opinions that you had when you gave these books
to the world. Are you still willing to have it thought to be
probably your opinion that Berni is better than Bojardo?
I am inclined to like Domenichi better than Berni, because
he is so much nearer Bojardo. Mr. Hallam speaks of him
with contempt. I doubt if he had paid much attention to
either.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have also been reading the ‘Orlandino’ and the ‘Ricciardetto.’
All these poems have an interest attaching to them as
parts of a great chapter of literature. The last of them, at
least the first half of it, though far from unexceptionable,
seems to me better and not worse than Ariosto, in the one
point for which he is justly censured.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>A few graceful words to the same effect were also
received by Panizzi from Sir W. Temple:—“Should
the aid of friends be necessary, I hope you will reckon
me among the number.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The following letter, with which the present
chapter concludes, distinctly proves of what stuff
Settembrini was composed, and the same commendation
may, without presumption, be extended to his
companions:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“Santo Stefano, December 3rd, 1855.</div>

<p class='c001'>“To think that you and your generous friends should have
spent so much time and money, and should have undertaken
a long journey all in vain, grieves me beyond measure, for I
can imagine all you must have done and hoped to achieve,
and how disappointed you must have been at the unfortunate
results. Do not, however, think of me; I am inured to
suffering, and am not worth so much trouble. I grieve on
your account, the more as my own ill-luck seems to pursue
those who interest themselves on my behalf. Should you be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>forced to give this matter up, do not let it vex or trouble
you.... Do not distress yourself about me and my companions;
we have lost but one hope more, and we have lost
so many already, the greater loss is his who has laboured and
spent, and done so much in vain. If the matter is still delayed,
and if, nevertheless, you and your friends are still
willing to conduct it to an issue, you will be guided by
your generous and noble hearts rather than by our merits.
In such case give me timely advice, in order that I may inform
you if it is still possible for us to do anything to second
your efforts, and also whether any unforeseen obstacle may
not render it necessary to change the original plan....”</p>

After the suppression of Mazza, a
marked change for the better took
place in the general conduct of the
Neapolitan Police. Bianchini, the new
Minister, presented in every way a
favourable contrast to his predecessor in office. Under
his gentle rule, the normal system of oppression was
relaxed, and the strongest front faced those dangers,
arising from revolutionary incendiarism, which the
cause of Liberty was perpetually incurring. ‘There
is a lull,’ wrote Sir Wm. Temple to Panizzi (Jan. 17th
1856) ‘in the proceedings of the Police; Campagna
has been kept in order, and there are no longer attacks
upon <em>hats</em> and <em>beards</em>; and people breathe more freely,’
Though the ardour for the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>chasse aux rouges</i></span> had sensibly
diminished, and the King’s subjects were enjoying their
liberty—quite a novelty to them—of being able to walk
abroad in comparative security, it must not be supposed
that the benefits arising from the improved state of things
had extended to those political adversaries who were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>already in durance. Of carrying out his schemes
for the rescue of Settembrini and his companions at
San Stefano, Panizzi, notwithstanding his former
failure, had by no means abandoned hope or intention.
In framing his future projects to this end, he
had met at Genoa, where he now was, with valuable
assistance, in the shape of the counsel and co-operation
of Dr. Bertani. After deducting the loss
sustained by the wreck of the “Isle of Thanet,” for
it was not fully insured, there remained still in hand
a considerable sum of money, a portion of the fund
lately set on foot for the liberation of the prisoners.
This sum, until some further design for accomplishing
the rescue had been definitely determined upon,
Panizzi felt some scruple in retaining; and accordingly
wrote to the respective donors of the money
offering to return the contributions.</p>

<p class='c001'>They, however, with one or two exceptions, preferred
to leave the whole of their subscriptions in his
possession, to be applied by him either to the main
purpose, or to such uses as, in his judgment, might
seem best for the benefit of Settembrini and his
family, who were at this time in a state of the deepest
distress. The letters of Lord Overstone and Lord
Zetland seem worthy of reproduction:—</p>

<p class='c001'>Here we may pause for an instant to reflect on the
steadiness of Panizzi’s character. With an aim in
view he was never faint-hearted or desponding, even
when the victim of constantly repeated rebuffs; it is
well to note this ever-recurring trait in his character,
for the recollection may serve as an encouragement
to others who might be inclined to despair instead of
imitating his example.</p>

<p class='c001'>The “Settembrini Fund,” amounting to about
£1,000, was finally entrusted to the charge and management
of Mr. Gladstone, and by him securely
invested in England.</p>

<p class='c001'>Meantime, a new influence had been brought to
bear at Naples on the fortunes of Settembrini and the
rest. The King had concluded with the Government
of the Argentine Republic a Convention, whereby he
was to be at liberty to deport to that State such political
offenders (including, as it would appear, others
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>of a different and more criminal caste) detained at this
time in the Neapolitan prisons, as should choose to avail
themselves of the commutation for exile proffered
them. It is not clear whether this alternative was
actually offered to Settembrini, Poerio, and their immediate
companions; but it is evident, not only that they
would have been at perfect liberty to avail themselves
of it, but that the King would have been delighted to
rid himself of them by the means proposed. The
question whether or not they would be adopting a
judicious course of action in agreeing to the terms
offered by the Convention, and accepting the modicum
of liberty they could purchase at the price of expatriation,
divided their friends and benefactors into
two factions.</p>

<p class='c001'>On one side, Panizzi himself was strongly opposed
to their taking such steps, and vehemently supported
a different course, viz., that they should petition the
King directly for their pardon and release. He appears,
and, to judge from his own words, not unreasonably,
to have suspected something latent in the
Convention which might prove an insurmountable
obstacle to the voluntary return of the exiles from
their new country to the old, or, indeed, to Europe in
general. In a letter to Lacaita (February 17th, 1857)
he thus expressed himself strongly on the subject:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“I wish you would try to dissuade any Neapolitan prisoners
to accept the alternative of going to the Argentine Republic.
They have no guarantee or protection whatever that the conditions
under which they consent to go will be observed.
<em>They will be made slaves.</em> I know very well the agent who
has set this going: he is a most clever Alsatian Jew, who has
several times put together enormous fortunes by schemes and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>speculations of an adventurer, and who has been as many times
reduced to beggary. I know that some of the prisoners,
among others Poerio and Settembrini, have been offered by the
Neapolitan Government a free pardon, if they will petition the
King, and they have refused! This is not firmness, but foolhardiness.
There is nothing disparaging for a man who is
bound hand and foot, and has a dagger put to his throat, to
ask to be released. Any man, however brave, will run away
from a mad dog. If they were asked to acknowledge themselves
guilty, would be right to refuse, and rather die
in prison; but it is sheer folly to refuse to ask to be let out.
This is the opinion of <em>all</em> their friends here. It seems that
Fagan urges them to go to America.</p>

<p class='c001'>The position of matters at this time, as regards
carrying out the terms of the Convention, was reported
to Lord Shelburne, who had been requested
to consult Lord Clarendon on the subject. This,
however, he appears not to have considered of any
very great importance. Mr. Gladstone seems equally
to have oscillated between the two alternatives of
exile to La Plata and a petition for a not dishonourable
pardon:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“February 5th, 1857.</div>

<p class='c001'>“My dear Panizzi,</p>

<p class='c013'>The paper on the Argentine Colonization reads
well, but everything depends on the good faith of the parties.
What are the guarantees for the fulfilment of the terms? I
see them not. On the other hand, I agree with you that if a
petition could be framed, praying in terms of due respect for
liberation, without directly or indirectly confessing guilt, there
could be no dishonour in presenting it.</p>

  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>On the other hand, Lord Palmerston, though he
expresses no belief one way or other, yet perceives
in the possible want of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>bona fides</i></span> in carrying out
the Convention on either side, not in the proposal of
emigration, the chance that the prisoners might have
to submit to that deprivation of future liberty, so much

liberty is worth purchasing by two voyages across the
Atlantic.</p>

<p class='c018'>Settembrini, meanwhile, distracted by the diversity
of opinion among his friends, and perplexed by the
strenuous opposition displayed by Panizzi to the emigration
scheme, applied to Mr. Fagan for explanation of this
apparently uncalled for opposition, and for further
advice as to his own action. As regards the alternative
of petitioning the King for pardon, we confess
that, on the point of honour, we coincide more
strongly in Settembrini’s opinions, stated in the following
letter, than in the views expressed in Panizzi’s
letter to Lacaita. What the former wrote to Mr.
Fagan is so well worth reading, and so characteristic
of the writer, that we make no apology for presenting
long extracts.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span></div>
<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“Santo Stefano, March 2nd, 1857.</div>

<p class='c018'>“My dear Mr. Fagan,—</p>

<p class='c019'>The kindness which you have at all times
shown me emboldens me to write and explain to you a plan of
mine which appears to me reasonable, and to beg you to let
me know through my wife (who will be the bearer of this
letter) whether there is anything on which I might be misinformed.
Mr. Panizzi, in the name of his friends and himself,
advises me to ask for a pardon. He evidently sees no
other way, and I myself have given up hope. He tells me on
no account to accept an offer to go to the Argentine Republic,
but for what reason I am unable to discover, though I have
mused over it for days. Mr. Panizzi is to me such an authority,
I respect, love, and owe him so much, in fact, that I am
really grieved to find myself differing from him. I feel sure
that he has either been misinformed as to my intentions, or
that he knows more than I do. As in his letter he seems to
have expressed his settled conviction, I will not write to him,
for it would seem discourteous to contradict him. For this
reason I beg you will tell me whether you know what has induced
Mr. Panizzi to give me this advice, or, at least, to explain
to him my motives, if you approve of them. You, my
dear Sir, having lived amongst us for so many years, and
knowing so well both the intentions and opinions of the
Government and the Liberal party, can understand how,
under present circumstances, a request for pardon is not
merely a personal matter, is not only the sacrifice of one’s
dignity, and of that legitimate pride which every honest man
ought to feel; it is not merely coming to terms with a robber
or highwayman, and begging him to spare your life, but it is
a matter of public interest, and means the recantation of
political creed, and the recognition as right and legal of all
the enormous injustice committed during the last nine years.
It would be telling the nation we have all been in the wrong;
it would be giving the lie to England and France (who have
solemnly condemned the conduct of the Neapolitan <a id='corr152.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Government;'>Government;)</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_152.1'><ins class='correction' title='Government;'>Government;)</ins></a></span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>it would be saying to the public opinion of Europe,
you have been deceived. The Neapolitan Government well
knows the value of such requests, and, while using all manner
of insinuations and suggestions to extort them, will not take
them into consideration unless they are of the most abject
character, wishing not only to humiliate, but to degrade the
applicants. I would sooner remain here than leave
my prison through such a door. I know that many others
have asked for mercy, and I do not blame them, but I trust
no one will blame me for my irrevocable resolve....
Such pardon as the Government offers is contemptible, and
death or the galleys would be preferable. My honour and
conscience are my own, no power in the world can rob me
of these my last possessions.  I am thoroughly convinced
that in asking for a reprieve I should injure both myself and
our common cause, therefore I have decided not to make an
application on any terms. There still remains one honourable
way of leaving my prison. By going to America my
personal dignity would not suffer, for it is the Government
who offers, not I who ask. It will do no harm to the common
cause; for though it may appear that in leaving I show a
want of confidence in the country, yet I shall give no grounds
for suspicion that in remaining I wish to ask or accept pardon.
Oh, my dear sir, in this prison I am daily losing intelligence,
conscience, and all human feeling, and the thought that for
the last seven years I have lived on other people’s charity breaks
my heart and aggravates my troubles. This state of things
is insupportable.  To escape from it a year ago I ran great
risk, and now I would go not only to the Argentine Republic
or Patagonia, but even to Victoria or the Pole. I never
had any intention of settling abroad, but would remain
there as short a time as possible, returning to Europe and
Piedmont, there to meet my poor wife and beloved son, and live
on the fruits of my own labour. It would merely be banishment
to Piedmont with the preliminary conditions of twice
crossing the ocean, even for those who could not return so soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>to Europe, the journey would not be altogether an evil,
for either our country would remain as it is (and the
Argentine Republic would be preferable to a prison), or
matters will change for the better, and then they could at any
time return home. This opinion seems reasonable to me; but
on perusing Mr. Panizzi’s letter, I am so impressed by his
authority that I have hesitated. I have racked my brains to
find reasons for the contrary, and have found none to satisfy
me. The Convention has not met with favour in this country
for I believe two reasons—prejudice against a Government
which, being hated, cannot please in what it does, and also
from sheer ignorance, which associates the ideas of a disastrous
and interminable journey to a country haunted by yellow fever
and infested with savages and all sorts of horrors. None but
the ignorant multitude would attach importance to such
rumours. Many have tried to persuade me that once despatched
to those regions we should never be allowed to return,
and that the Convention has been artfully drawn up to lead us
into a trap. Abiding, however, by the first and trustworthy
information which you, Sir, most kindly imparted to my wife,
I still believe that the man who does not accept the conditions
of a colonist (and who lets the Government know that he
wants nothing from it, but will live at his own expense) could
not be compelled to submit to any restrictions, but might remain
or return at his own pleasure. It is quite just
that a colonist who contracts a debt should be watched,
and not allowed to depart without satisfying all
claims; but he who accepts nothing owes nothing.
It would be an enormity of a novel kind should the Argentine
Republic consent to act as the police of the Bourbons, and become
the jailers of their political prisoners. It would be a
pretty sort of recommendation to Europe, a fine inducement
to strangers to settle in Argentina, if they were to act thus in
total opposition to the spirit and letter of their constitution,
which, thanks to your kindness, I have read. I therefore repeat
my belief that there would be no difficulty in leaving the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>place, and that no secret conventions exist in that respect; but
if you, dear Sir, should now think differently, or even suspect
anything of the kind, I beg you let me know frankly; I earnestly
entreat this, as it is to me a matter of the greatest importance.
In consequence of your assurance that it would be
possible to return to Europe (and from what I have myself
read in the Convention) I am firmly persuaded that it will be
the most reasonable course to go. Mr. Panizzi now advises
me not to do so, without, however, stating his reasons, and I
beg you to relieve me of my doubts as soon as possible. My
future intentions would be (if allowed to return) to embark
immediately in any merchant vessel at hand, and sail for Genoa
or Marseilles. Three years ago my son Raffaele went to
Monte Video in a trading vessel, and made the voyage out and
back in less than ten months, including the time of his stay
there, which was not short. The voyage from La Plata to
Genoa could be accomplished in two months, or even
less. Now I cannot discover any injury to either the public
cause or myself in all this. If others see harm I would beg
them to indicate clearly in what it is, in order that I may
alter my opinion and do nothing painful to myself or displeasing
to those who love me and whom I both love and
respect. To your courtesy, my dear Sir, I look for the answer
which will either change my opinion or confirm me in the intention
which at present seems reasonable to me. In conclusion
I must inform you that all political prisoners, including
those confined at Ponza and Ventotene, have been asked
whether or not they are willing to go to the Argentine Republic
(we galley slaves alone excepted). I cannot assign any
reason for this exception. I do not know whether the Government
are unwilling to send us out, whether they have reserved
us for a second expedition, or have abandoned the whole
matter from irritation at the refusal of almost all the prisoners.
But I believe that, in spite of the delay, the matter will still
be carried into effect, even for us <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“forzati”</span> who are kept here
as so much refuse from the gallows.</p>

<div class='c011'>Yours, &amp;c., &amp;c.,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class='sc'>Luigi Settembrini</span>.”</div>

</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>Whether the Convention had already turned out a
“complete failure” or not, the pace at which the
whole business was progressing must have given ample
time to Settembrini to make up his own mind, as well
as to collect and digest all the advice worth following
as to the line of action best for him to adopt. The
parties to the Convention, and notably the King himself,
seem certainly to have been in no hurry to bring
the affair to a climax. “Nothing is known,” wrote
Mr. Fagan again to Panizzi (April 25th, 1857,) “with
certainty respecting the affair of the political prisoners.
The two frigates which are now being fitted out
will not be ready for sea before the end of next month.
The general impression appears to be that about 250
persons will be sent, but they are all men belonging
to the lower class, and not all condemned for political
offences.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>In this stage of delay and uncertainty we will take
the liberty to leave the proceedings for the present, in
order to bring on the scene another character, afterwards
a somewhat intimate acquaintance of Panizzi’s—it
would be
scarcely warrantable
to call him a
friend—in notoriety,
more than equal
to Poerio or Settembrini,
but not
as they were, of
honourable and untarnished
celebrity.
Few are living but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>have heard or read of Felice Orsini; equally few
are they who do not hold both the man and his
criminal intentions in deep execration.  He was
born at Meldole, in the States of the Church, in
1819.  From his youth upwards, his fixed idea,
his sole purpose of life was Revolution; conspiracy
was to him as the breath of his nostrils.
It cannot in strict truth be alleged that he absolutely
and deliberately set his mind on murder, as the
surest or most desirable means to accomplish his
object, but neither can it be denied that if
murder became a most necessary ingredient in his
plans, if it showed him the easiest way, he was
ready, without scruple even, to adopt such fell
measures. Orsini’s first imprisonment for political
crime was in 1844. In February, 1845, he was again
convicted before the Supreme Tribunal of Rome, and
condemned to the galleys for life, for a plot against the
Government. Fortunately for himself, he was comprised
in the general amnesty of the 16th of July,
1846, published by Pius IX. on his accession to the
Papal chair, and released, or perhaps it ought to be
said let loose, in the same year. In May, 1847, he
was expelled from Tuscany for his political intrigues.
Two years afterwards he was elected a Deputy in the
Roman Constituent Assembly; but, in 1853, was
forced to quit Roman territory. He first sought
refuge in London, which, however, in a short time,
he left, and for a period was busied in roaming
through Piedmont, Switzerland, and Lombardy,
continually, wherever he went, plotting and scheming
under the assumed name of Tito Celci. He was next
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>heard of under the name of Hernof, at Vienna, in
1855, when he was arrested and sent to the fortress
of Mantua. Thence, by energy and skill, no less
by good fortune, he made his escape in the night of
28th-29th March, of the same year. He next visited
Marseilles and Genoa, whence he returned to London.
At this period he was on most intimate terms with
Mazzini. Their friendship, however, was not of lifelong
duration: it ended in a quarrel.</p>

<p class='c018'>By Mazzini, it appears, Orsini was first introduced
to Panizzi; but the introduction must have been
merely formal, as there is no record of any intercourse
between the two arising therefrom, and Panizzi
seems to have lost sight of him very soon afterwards.
However on the 14th of August, 1856, he was recommended
by Mr. John Craufurd as a proper person to
become a reader in the Library of the British Museum.
The letter of introduction was delivered by Orsini
himself, on the 18th of the same month, when he
met with Panizzi, and a strong mutual liking for one
another sprang up. In fact, as we know from the
best of sources, this sympathetic feeling very nearly
assumed the proportions of friendship; for Panizzi
expressed himself as never having been so much captivated
by any one as by Orsini. The familiarity thus
quickly established, showed early signs of endurance;
and the following letter, which throws a good deal of
light as well on the character as on the history of the
writer, may be read with interest:—</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>“My dear Sir,</p>

<p class='c019'>I have examined the Catalogue of the Library
respecting the Art and Science of Warfare. It is but poorly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>furnished with the most instructive works published during
and after the wars of Napoleon. It is the same with the
United Service Institution, where I was admitted for the
purpose of consulting the books which I required for the
composition of the military work that I have in hand, and I
have in consequence had to order various books from France
at my own expense; but, however, I shall soon have to study
the work of which I send you the title: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“La grande Tactique
du Marquis de Ternay,”</span> Colonel of the Staff. These works,
especially that of Martray, I could not procure on account of
the expense, but should you think it desirable for the Library
to acquire them, it would be of great assistance to me. The
Paris edition of Ternay’s work ought not to cost more than
25 francs, and that of Brussels much less. The work which
I am engaged upon will be in English, and contain all the
information required by officers in the field, from the Sub-Lieutenants
of the three branches of which an army is composed,
up to the Chief Staff Officer inclusive. It is a serious
undertaking as it must be restricted to a portable volume,
and include, with clearness and conciseness, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>omne
scibile</i></span> of military affairs. With diligence and assiduity,
assisted by the studies of my youthful days, I promise
myself I shall succeed; still it is a work I shall not
be able to finish in less than six or eight months.
While thus engaged, I could devote some hours a day to
other occupations, and I should like, if possible, to give
lessons in the Italian language, literature, and in military art
and science. Having been myself major of the staff, I can
give good lessons in the latter, and am tolerably conversant
with the former. Up to the present time my life has been
unusually eventful, and passed mostly amidst dangers—a
constant source of anxiety to my family, who have suffered no
slight losses on my account. As I am a little more quiet
just now, I wish to derive advantage from my acquirements,
while awaiting the longed-for moment when I may once again
take up arms for our independence.  I have been advised to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>advertise in the <cite>Times</cite> that I am willing to give lessons; I
should not like to do this, it would seem as if I wished to
turn my good name to profit, although, instead of such an expedient,
I think, if you would, you might greatly assist me
amongst your acquaintances, and in any case I am quite ready
to follow your advice. With my private life you are not,
however, acquainted; but on this I give you full liberty to
apply even to my adversaries, whether in opinion, or party,
or otherwise, for we all have such. Of languages, I know
French well, and for private lessons can make myself understood
in English. I have written this to avoid troubling
you, and if you will kindly let me know, I can
call upon you at any time for better advice as
to what I have said here. On political affairs I know
nothing positive, but keep myself (as I told you) independent
of every one, and should the Sardinian Government deem my
slender services available for any enterprise, however daring,
I am, and always shall be, ready, I mean, of course, for the independence
of my native land; for that, since I could understand
the idea, I have ever been restless, and have sacrificed
all. In saying I am ready to lend a hand to the Sardinian
Government, I am influenced solely by the love of my country
and by the conviction that at the present time, if it will, it is
the only Government that can render Italy <em>independent</em>, <em>united</em>,
and <em>great</em>; and I shall think myself happy if, by devoting all
my energies in an important act, fraught with <em>serious consequences</em>
to the oppressors of Italy, I can at the same time put
an end to a life which has so far been for me but sad, passionate,
and melancholy. Pardon this expression of my feelings.
From what I hear, it appears that my little book has met with
some success, even in Piedmont and with all parties; certainly
I have in no way exaggerated, but endeavoured to impress the
necessity of sacrificing all political principle to the National
Independence. I have done so myself since my first imprisonment
in 1844. Nothing remains for me now but to beg you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>to excuse this long letter, and with every respect to assure you
that I am,</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Dear Sir, your very humble and devoted servant,</div>
      <div class='line in32'><span class='sc'>Felice Orsini</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c018'>In another letter, dated “Glastonbury, 7th February,
1857,” he says in further development of his
political dreams:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“The book, with the documents, &amp;c. ... is now
finished.... In an introduction I insist on this
point, that all our efforts should be directed towards
the national independence. “While thus engaged,
every thought of political theories must rest in peace;
we are bound to be on the side of that Italian
Government which, excluding the Pope and any
foreign dynasty, will furnish us with the means of
making war on Austria. All this I say with the
frankness that has been natural to me throughout
life, with the patriotic ardour that ever burns within
me, and with the firm <em>conviction</em> that by such conduct
alone can the Italians work their redemption.”</p>

<p class='c018'>To refer to the hideous, and, it may be said with
justice, the vulgar crime of which Orsini and his
accomplices were guilty, is not here necessary, further
than will suffice to refresh the memory of the reader.
The attempt took place on the evening of the 14th of
January, 1858, at the moment when the Emperor
Napoleon III. and the Empress arrived at the Opera.
The details are too well known to need repetition.
On March 13th following Orsini was guillotined.</p>

<p class='c018'>That the crime had been long premeditated, and
that Orsini had not been impelled to it by any
sudden frenzied impulse, is clear from a passage in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>defence of himself, if defence it could be called, on
his trial:—“From my youth,” said he, “I have only
had one object, and one fixed idea, the deliverance of
my country, and vengeance against the Austrians, and
I have constantly conspired against them up to 1848....
When in England, I was imbued with a
mania of being useful to my country. I witnessed
ridiculous attempts being made by Mazzini, who sent
15 or 20 men to Italy, where they lost their lives. I
tried loyal means; I went over to England, and in all
the meetings which I addressed, advocated the principle
of non-intervention.... After the fall
of Rome, I felt convinced that Napoleon would no
longer assist us: and I said to myself, that man must
be killed.... I am very sorry that so many
people were wounded, and if my blood could repair
this misfortune, I am quite ready to give it for the
people. Here it is!” These words were described
by the French newspapers at the time as bombastic—an
epithet singularly out of place. Terrible they
might well be called, and full of ghastly meaning:
witnesses not only to the atrocity of the crime itself,
but to the length of time—two whole years—during
which the plot to commit it had been in process of
elaboration.</p>

<p class='c018'>On the eve of his execution, Orsini addressed a
letter to the Emperor, in which he said:—“Near the
close of my career, I yet wish to make a last effort,
for the sake of Italy. Her independence has hitherto
prompted me to defy all dangers, to court all sacrifices.
<em>Italy has been the constant object of my affections,
and this is the last thought that I wish to record
in the words which I address to your Majesty.</em>“</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>
<img src='images/i_b_161.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c018'>Let the reader compare the passage with Orsini’s
letters to Panizzi. The death of Napoleon, considered
so necessary to the cause of
Italian Union by Orsini, might
possibly not have promoted that
good end. But could it have
been that the alarm caused to the
Emperor by the assassin’s attempt
was one of the chief reasons that
led him to take arms against
Austria in 1859?</p>

<p class='c018'>It has been told the writer of
this memoir, on various occasions
in the course of conversation, that, when the news
appeared in the second edition of the <cite>Times</cite> of Saturday,
January 16th, 1858, that “Orsini or Corsini” had
attempted the murder of the Emperor, Panizzi, who
was in the habit of visiting Brooks’s every afternoon,
was at once, and on that very Saturday, questioned
by other members of the Club whether the assassin
was his friend. Panizzi replied that he doubted it
very much, seeing that he himself had an appointment
with Orsini for the following day, when they were
both to call on Lord Palmerston together. This
was thought at the time to be a deep but futile
scheme for establishing an <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>alibi</i></span>. Of the truth
of the story we have no evidence beyond what
we have mentioned. So far as we have been able to
ascertain, there is nothing to show that Orsini was in
London at all in this month of January. It is a
matter of regret that we cannot help the reader further
to judge of the truth or falsehood of the anecdote.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>As we would not ourselves be held to have painted
the would-be assassin in too dark a colour, so would
we willingly grant all indulgence to any who, from
merely reading the facts of his history, should be inclined
to depict him in the deepest of hues. That, by
many ordinary Englishmen, such a man, who scrupled
not to attack and destroy all, known or unknown, who
stood in his way, might aptly be called the mad dog
of society, is perfectly conceivable. But, granting all
that can be brought against him, and in no wise seeking
to justify his actions, we nevertheless submit that
the character of Orsini is rather deserving of careful
study, and even of allowance, if that study be made
fully and without prejudice, than of hasty condemnation.
A fanatic of fanatics, he was undoubtedly, both
to friends and foes, the most dangerous of men; but
he had also the good points of a fanatic—he was unselfish,
and of necessity disinterested. If, to use the
mildest of terms, he little more than undervalued his
neighbour’s life, he at least threw his own into the
balance. Nor can it be denied, from what has been
said and quoted above, that patriotism (unenlightened
it might be, carried to a crime as it assuredly was,
yet earnest and sincere, and having no taint of self-seeking,
though much of self-imposture), was the
man’s one inspiration throughout his life. That
personally he was not of a vulgarly brutal cast of
mind is evident if only from his letters to Panizzi.
His learning and ability were more than common
place; as a soldier his skill and courage were unquestioned.
We would be content to speak of him,
however, in no higher terms than were employed by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>his advocate at his trial. “He was not there,” said
M. Jules Favre, “either to justify or to save his client,
but he came there with the wish to endeavour to cast
on his immortal soul some rays of that truth which
he trusted would protect his memory against the
execration of posterity.”</p>

<div class='c021'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/dc_t.png' width='150' height='147' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
The scheme for getting rid of the political
offenders, whose charge daily
increased upon the Neapolitan authorities
in the ratio of captivity to their
victims, was coming near its accomplishment.
On the 27th of Dec. 1858, a decree was
issued by the King, offering to the prisoners, in
accordance with the Argentine Convention, choice
between emigration and continuance of durance. This
decree commenced as follows, in words possibly not
intended to be ironical: ‘By the Grace of God, &amp;c.
Having given proofs of our sovereign clemency to the
greater part of those condemned for offences against
the security of the State during the events of 1848-9,’
&amp;c. It was read to the prisoners, who, with one
exception, accepted the conditions. The single voice
constituting the minority overbalanced the majority.
Poerio refused to accept any of this qualified liberty.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Better,” said he, “death on the gallows than this
futile and costly journey to a far off land, there to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>meet a death more obscure and less honoured.” This
refusal of the leading criminal to accept his freedom
under the Convention was of such importance that
the idea of any treaty was abandoned, and the whole
plan for the deportation of the prisoners fell to the
ground. Nor was his resolution to bide his time in
captivity fruitless. On the 6th of January, 1859, a
second decree, in substitution of the former, was
promulgated, the main point of which was that certain
of the prisoners, in number sixty-six, including
Poerio and Settembrini, should be at liberty to leave
the galleys on condition of going to New York.</p>

<p class='c018'>This was readily accepted by the select number,
and on the 16th of January, Poerio arrived at
Pozzuoli, where, on the same day, he embarked on
board the “Stromboli,” a vessel which had been
fitted up as a prison. Pironti, eminent amongst those
oppressed by the Neapolitan Government, had been
attacked by paralysis, and was left behind in safe custody.</p>

<p class='c018'>Poerio, on his embarkation, was still in chains, and
little provision had been made for the comforts of
the party on starting for their voyage across the
Atlantic. No adequate or suitable clothing was
provided for them, and, as a matter of fact, they were
literally in rags.</p>

<p class='c018'>Meanwhile, in London Panizzi was alert for the
safety and protection of the exiles in case they reached
New York. The United States Government, about
that time, had repeatedly protested against some of
the European <a id='corr165.30'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Goverments'>Governments</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_165.30'><ins class='correction' title='Goverments'>Governments</ins></a></span> deporting their paupers,
jail-birds and prisoners to America, and threatened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>not only to prevent their landing, but to compel the
captains who brought them to take them back. Of
course no serious apprehensions were entertained for
those Italians, if they fell into the right hands at
first. Panizzi consulted Mr. Henry Stevens, who
recommended that correct information and supplies
should be sent direct to the Collector of Customs in
New York, and in such manner arouse his personal
interest in the patriots. Accordingly the following
letter was written by Mr. Stevens to Mr. Schell, who
not only took a lively interest in the affair himself, but
encouraged others to the same purpose. A steamer
was kept for many days in readiness to go down the Bay
to meet Poerio and his companions and welcome them
to New York. It was, therefore, no slight disappointment
when the news was received that they had found
their way to England.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>“My dear Sir,</p>

<p class='c019'>You are doubtless familiar with the story of the
Italians whom the King of Naples, since his amnesty at the
end of December last, has sent to New York. There are sixty
or seventy of them, and it is expected that they will reach
America towards the end of February. They go from Naples
to Cadiz by steamer, and will probably be transhipped there to
a merchant vessel about the 22nd of January.</p>

<p class='c018'>Much interest is felt and expressed for them here, and I
have no doubt, as they are all exiles for political offences, they
will receive a cordial welcome on our shores.</p>

<p class='c018'>I take the liberty not only to call your attention to them, but
to request that you will be so good as to deliver, as early as possible
after their arrival, the enclosed letter to one of them, Mr.
Luigi Settembrini. The letter is from Mr. Panizzi, the Chief
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>Officer of the British Museum, who takes a deep interest in
them all, but more especially in Mr. Luigi Settembrini and
Baron Carlo Poerio, both gentlemen of distinction, the latter
formerly a Minister of State.</p>

<p class='c018'>The letter to Mr. Settembrini contains matters of importance,
and will direct him and others to Messrs. Brown Brothers &amp; Co.
where they will find <em>something to their advantage</em>.</p>

<p class='c018'>I will only add that some little apprehension has been expressed
lest the <em>manner</em> in which the King of Naples has sent
these unfortunates to our shores might bring trouble upon
them; but their misfortunes are too well known to warrant
the belief that exiles for political opinions will be opposed on
their landing in the <em>Land of Freedom</em>.</p>

<p class='c018'>They will not be destitute, thank God, when they land.
Besides the sum of fifty dollars given by the King to each one,
they will be provided for by private hands.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>

      <div class='line in18'>(Of Vermont).”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c018'>It was on board the “Stromboli” that Poerio and
Settembrini met for the first time since their captivity.
Little opportunity was, however, afforded for
the moment of renewing their acquaintance with
each other, for the former, shortly after his arrival
on board, was seized with severe illness, and compelled
to keep his bed.</p>

<p class='c018'>It is pleasing to relate an instance of true kindness
and humanity on the part of at least one officer connected
with the Neapolitan Government, and to record
that Ferdinando Cafiero, Commander of the “Stromboli,”
directed that his illustrious prisoner should be
placed in his own (the captain’s) cabin.</p>

<p class='c018'>They set sail, escorted by the “Ettore Fieramosca,”
man-of-war; and the writer of this “Memoir,” as an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>eye-witness of their departure, well recollects the
enthusiasm displayed on the occasion. On their way
to Gibraltar they fell in with a Sardinian vessel, flying
the national tricolour. This was a signal for the
exiles to run on deck, and, with deep emotion, salute
the flag, the symbol of liberty and good government
in Italy. On the 26th of January, they reached
Cadiz, where another ship was to be chartered to take
them to the United States.</p>

<p class='c018'>One morning, while at Cadiz, Settembrini was sent
for on board the “Ettore Fieramosca,” a message
reaching him that an English officer wished to speak
to him. Here a great and most agreeable surprise
awaited him. His astonishment can scarcely be conceived
when he recognised in the English officer his
own son Raffaele.<a id='rF' /><a href='#fF' class='c015'><sup>[F]</sup></a> At this time Raffaele was but a
youth in the merchant service. Having been at
school in England, he spoke English fluently, and in
language and general appearance was well fitted for
the character he had assumed. He had taken the
name of James, and represented himself as the captain
of a merchantman trading between London and
Madeira.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='fF'>
<p class='c018'><a href='#rF'>F</a>. Now a distinguished officer in the Italian Navy.</p>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Anything like friendly converse between father and
son at this meeting was, of course, out of the question,
but the latter managed to transmit the whispered words,
<em>You shall not go to America</em>. Captain “James,” it should
be mentioned, had reached Cadiz by means of a plan
carried out through the agency of the Neapolitan
consul at that port, and concerted in London by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>Panizzi. All things being thus happily arranged, the
party embarked in the American ship, “David
Stewart,” commanded by Captain Prentiss. The
“David Stewart” was very well found, and comfortable
accommodation seems to have been provided <em>for
her passengers</em>.</p>

<p class='c018'>Two days afterwards, she started in tow of the
“Stromboli,” and escorted by the “Ettore Fieramosca,”
which had orders to see her well out to sea.
Having established a good offing, the two Neapolitan
men-of-war returned. Captain “James,” meantime,
had shown himself equal to the occasion. He had
changed his character of master of a merchant vessel
for that of steward on board the American vessel. On
the night of the Neapolitan’s departure, he communicated
to his father a design which he had formed for
compelling the Captain to return to Lisbon, adding
that, in case resistance was offered, he was provided
with arms to enforce compliance.</p>

<p class='c018'>Settembrini, as might be expected, listened eagerly
to his son’s proposal; but, in accordance with his
general demeanour, strongly objected to violence of
any sort.</p>

<p class='c018'>The design was forthwith imparted to the exiles,
who were sufficiently numerous to carry the point
without resort to force. By an accident, they were
driven to act a little prematurely, but, as it happened,
in no way detrimentally to their ultimate success. A
seaman trod on a percussion cap, and the explosion
gave the alarm to the captain. On this the passengers
at once took action, and, presenting to him a
protest against being taken to New York, demanded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>that he should make for the first port he could reach
in England. The captain, one-third of whose freight
had been retained as a guarantee for the performance
of his contract, remonstrated, and the demand was
for the moment not pressed. On the following
morning, however, it was repeated in a more decided
manner. The exiles drew attention to their numbers,
being 66 as against 17 of the ship’s hands; they
represented that, having suffered much from their
confinement, and many of them being of advanced
age, they were not in a state to undergo with safety a
long voyage, and added that one of their number,
being well skilled in navigation, would man&oelig;uvre the
ship, in case the captain and crew should refuse their
assistance. This skilled seaman was none other than
Raffaele, who had appeared in yet a new <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>rôle</i></span>, and
came on deck in a mate’s uniform of the Galway line
of steamers. The passengers, of course, met with
little further opposition. They quietly took possession
of the vessel, setting watches, and taking all
precautions to ensure due execution by the captain
of their orders, which were to make for Cork. The
weather proved obstructive, and the voyage tedious,
but in the course of a fortnight, they were safely landed
at Queenstown.</p>

<p class='c018'>Great was the excitement caused here by the
arrival of the distinguished visitors, with whom heartfelt
sympathy had for so long been expressed in every
part of the United Kingdom. Lively as was the
pleasure expressed at their safety in these countries,
the disappointment felt by the inhabitants of New
York, who had prepared for Poerio and his companions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>the warmest reception, was equally keen.
The Italian residents had appointed a Committee to
supply funds for the emigrants to return to Sardinia,
which was understood to be their destination after
America. All was in readiness to give them a cordial
welcome. From Mr. Dallas, the American Minister,
Panizzi received the following short note:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Legation, U.S., London,</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>“My dear Mr. Panizzi,</p>

<p class='c019'>You will see by the enclosed newspaper

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c018'>It may be mentioned here that Panizzi, with the
concurrence of Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone, placed £100
at the disposal of Settembrini and Poerio, to be delivered
to them at Gibraltar, which sum, however, they
never received, not having landed there. This loss
was soon compensated by the good fortune which, as
we have narrated, had now befallen them. Not that
the enthusiasm shown in their behalf throughout the
country was likely to allow forgetfulness of the
necessity for material assistance. One of the first to
propose a mode of benefitting them was Charles
Dickens:—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>“My dear Panizzi,</p>

<p class='c019'>If you should feel no delicacy in mentioning, or see
no objection to mentioning, to Signor Poerio, or any of the
wronged Neapolitan gentlemen to whom it is your happiness
and honour to be a friend, on their arrival in this country, an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>idea that has occurred to me, I should regard it as a great
kindness in you if you would be my exponent. I think you
will have no difficulty in believing that I would not, on any
consideration, obtrude my name or projects upon any one of
those noble souls, if there were any reason of the slightest kind
against it. And if you see any such reason, I pray you instantly
to banish my letter from your thoughts.</p>

<p class='c018'>It seems to me probable that some narrative of their ten
years’ suffering will, somehow or other, sooner or later, be by
some of them laid before the English people. The just interest
and indignation alive here, will, I suppose, elicit it. False
narratives and garbled stories will, in any case, of a certainty
get about. If the true history of the matter is to be told, I
have that sympathy with them and respect for them which
would, all other considerations apart, render it unspeakably
gratifying to me to be the means of its diffusion. What I desire
to lay before them is simply this. If for my successor to
<cite>Household Words</cite> a narrative of their ten years’ trial could be
written, I would take any conceivable pains to have it rendered
into English, and presented in the sincerest and best way to a
very large and comprehensive audience. It should be published
exactly as you might think best for them, and remunerated
in any way that you might think generous and right.
They want no mouth piece and no introducer; but perhaps
they might have no objection to be associated with an English
writer, possibly not unknown to them by some general reputation,
and who certainly would be animated by a strong public
and private respect for their honour, spirit, and unmerited
misfortunes. This is the whole matter. Assuming that such
a thing is to be done, I long for the privilege of helping to do
it. These gentlemen might consider it an independent means
of making money, and I should be delighted to pay the
money.</p>

<p class='c018'>In my absence from town, my friend and sub-editor, Mr.
Wills (to whom I had expressed my feeling on the subject),
has seen, I think, three of the gentlemen together. But as I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>hear, returning home to-night, that they are in your good
hands, and as nobody can be a better judge than you of anything
that concerns them, I at once decide to write to you and
to take no other step whatever. Forgive me for the trouble I
have occasioned you in the reading of this letter, and never
think of it again if you think that by pursuing it you would
cause them an instant’s uneasiness.</p>

<p class='c018'>In London a Committee for the relief of the exiles
was formed, and large sums were received.</p>

<p class='c018'>The first letter Panizzi received from Poerio was
dated from Cork, 27th of March, 1859. In this
there was, however, little beyond an acknowledgment
of a letter received, and expression of gratitude for
the trouble taken on his behalf. Although Poerio,
starting from Cork on the 29th of March, soon joined
his friends in London, they had but little uninterrupted
enjoyment of each other’s company for some
time. Invitations poured in for the great exile from
every quarter. Amongst his entertainers may be
mentioned Lord Granville, the Duke of Sutherland,
the Marquis of Lansdowne, and the Duke of Argyll.</p>

<div class='c011'>“April 12th.</div>

<p class='c018'>“My dear Panizzi,</p>

<p class='c019'>Lady Charlotte Egerton asks, through me, Baron
Poerio and any one of his friends to her party to-night. Pray
let them appear if possible. They will find me there at 10.15.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c018'>This continued dissipation, and the cold of the
English climate, from which he suffered intensely,
began to weigh heavily on Poerio. He was forced
by his state of health to refuse many invitations, and
the only other amusement of which we have any record
is a visit to the House of Commons on the 18th of
April, under the auspices of Lord Shaftesbury.</p>

<p class='c018'>It would be too much to expect that amongst the
large number of sixty-six prisoners, however exalted
the political creed which they might profess, there
should not be at least one or two black sheep. There
were certainly some amongst the lower order of these
exiles, with whom Panizzi had a good deal of trouble.
Notwithstanding all his rigid justice in apportioning
the money of which he had the charge, they vexed
him much by claiming more than their share, by accusations
of unfairness, and, in some cases, even by
the vilest ingratitude and abuse. Nor did they confine
their annoyance to him alone. Poerio, writing
subsequently (3rd of June, 1859,) from Turin, gives
anything but a pleasing account of these gentry who
had accompanied him to Italy:—“I have had a great
deal of trouble here on account of the English subscription
in favour of the exiles. One of them who was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>destined to receive 250 francs told a great many in
secret that this terrible injustice of classification was
all my work,” with a good deal more to the same
effect, on which it is needless to expend time and
space.</p>

<p class='c018'>But the calls of patriotism were altogether too
urgent on Poerio to allow him to spend very much
of his time in London society. About the middle
of May he left for Turin, where he entered on a long
correspondence with Panizzi. Here, for the first time
in these volumes, we are able to present the reader with
a comprehensive letter from Poerio, although short extracts
from others have been given above. His letters
are, both in language and style, the acme of combined
nervousness and elegance, and we can only express our
regret that, to meet the exigencies of the general reader,
we are compelled to give this in English, feeling that
by translation the beauty and force of the original must
materially suffer. Most interesting in themselves, but
of still greater value as throwing light on contemporary
history, are the accounts of the sad continuance
of disorder and misgovernment in the administration
of Naples; of the various other complications in the
affairs of the Peninsula; the course of action adopted
by the French Emperor in connection with the attitude
of the Sardinian Government, (which last, Poerio
seems to consider occasionally as somewhat hesitating
and undecided); and the dawn of the first possibility of
effecting the union of distracted Italy, in the achievement
of which, however, a thousand difficulties seemed
yet to be overcome. Some few necessary excisions of
matter of little importance have been made, but this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>has not materially reduced the bulk of the correspondence.
Of Panizzi’s share we unfortunately possess
nothing. A good notion, however, of his opinions on
Italian, and (as connected with Italian) of European
politics, as well as of his unwearying efforts in the
cause, and the confidence that his compatriots rested
in his exertions and influence here, may be gathered
from the communications which he received from his
friend and others who had suffered from or witnessed
the revolting cruelties committed for so many years in
Naples and elsewhere; but there is no querulousness,
no recalling of the past; every energy, every aspiration,
is devoted to the one glorious object—the unity
and independence of Italy:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“Turin, 21st of August, 1859.</div>

<p class='c018'>“My dearest Panizzi,</p>

<p class='c019'>I send you my ideas respecting your project,
which would be excellent if it were only practicable.</p>

<p class='c018'>Your programme, if I mistake not, may be summed up as
follows:—The formation of a single Assembly of representatives
from the four States of Central Italy, such assembly to
proceed immediately—To confirm in common the separate
decisions arrived at with regard to the deposition of the Princes
and the annexation to Piedmont; to publish a manifesto to
Europe, short, but solemn, energetic, and rich in facts which
justify this severe but unavoidable determination; to
nominate a Regent, who shall assume in its entirety and in the
name of the Sardinian Government the exercise of executive
power, commencing with the appointment of a commander-in-chief
to all the forces now under arms, such forces to be combined
and formed into a single army. After this the Assembly
would adjourn, leaving the Regent full power to have himself
represented at the European Congress called for by this Assembly,
in order to obtain a decision in conformity with the solemn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>vote of the country, and to repel any aggression on the part of
<em>anybody</em> who might intend forcibly to reinstate the deposed
Princes.</p>

<p class='c018'>First of all I must take exception in <em>law</em> to the <em>judicial</em>
validity of the nomination of a Regent.</p>

<p class='c018'>A popular Assembly, legitimately elected, has most certainly
the right of declaring that the people represented by it intends
to choose for its Prince the monarch of another State, and intends
to identify itself with that State. But after this decision
has been arrived at, the logical and legal order of things
would be to address that Prince, in order to ascertain
whether he is willing to accept this free and spontaneous surrender.
If he accept, he alone can and in fact must nominate
an authority to govern the annexed provinces provisionally in
his name. The Assembly cannot do this, because, in
proclaiming a new Prince, it invests him with the sovereign
power. Victor Emmanuel proceeded in this way with the
Lombards, who submitted to him of their own free will—that
is to say, he nominated a Governor to rule in his name, neither
did he act otherwise towards the people from whom he
accepted the dictatorship. The only exception to this rule is
when it is <em>physically</em> impossible for the Prince who has been
proclaimed to speak his mind. It is not so in our case,
because the King of Piedmont reigns both by right and in deed,
and is personally free. He is, moreover, at the head of an
army, and has made himself a champion of the war of independence.
It is, therefore, necessary to address him. He is
not only able, but is bound to declare himself openly, and in
accepting he will be obliged to provide a government for those
provinces until an European Congress recognizes the fact as
accomplished, and includes him in the new public statute.
Most assuredly no one will ever assert that the
Congress ought to <em>compel</em> Victor Emmanuel to accept the
submission of Central Italy, unless he had openly acceded
at the proper time, and acted frankly in conformity with his
utterances. Silence in this case might be termed prudent; but it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>certainly would not be very generous, particularly if it be considered
that these people are determined to fight to the last
against anybody who would wish to prevent them from <em>belonging
to him</em>.</p>

<p class='c018'>According to your plan, I conclude that King Victor
Emmanuel must not only accept the surrender and nominate a
Vicegerent or Lieutenant who will govern under his guidance,
but must also prepare himself to protect and sustain the
annexed provinces to the utmost of his power, and at the
same time declare himself ready manfully to repel any aggression.
It would, in truth, not only be strange, but indecorous,
in a King invoked and proclaimed if he were to act negligently
and look on with indifference at the cruel sacrifice of
his new people, who are ready to shed the last drop of their
blood to preserve their fidelity to him.</p>

<p class='c018'>But this sacred duty will not be performed, and it is vain
to hope for it, because just now a timid rather than a spirited
policy prevails in the Piedmontese Cabinet.</p>

<p class='c018'>I do not wish utterly to condemn it, because I know but
too well the gravity of affairs generally, and the difficulties of
such a perilous situation. Possibly the requisite boldness
would amount to temerity, but it is none the less true that
when a man cannot, or does not wish to, run any risk or
leave anything to chance, he has no right to look for
brilliant or glorious results, neither can he expect to add
four millions of people to his own proper subjects without incurring
any risk, and merely by remaining a careless spectator
of the dangers to which others are exposed....</p>

<p class='c018'>Let us suppose that the Piedmontese Government can do
nothing to display a large amount of energy and tenacity
of purpose; let us suppose that, notwithstanding the safe remission,
the amalgamation of the four States, the single
Assembly, and the unanimous declaration, are matters of
supreme importance to the future of Italy, but how can one ever
hope for this fusion in the midst of such discordant elements?
It is true that the four States have formed a military confederation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>for mutual defence, but this fact of itself clearly shows
that there is no intention of proceeding further, and of forming
a single State....</p>

<p class='c018'>Everybody <em>apparently</em> wishes for the fusion with Piedmont,
but a great many object to the idea of a single State. Nor do
the Romans and the Tuscans, who are so different in character,
in customs, and in aspirations, intend to hold together. The
Duchies alone really wish for the union with Piedmont. The
Romans would in reality like a separate government, and the
Tuscans who reason closely, know that in the actual condition
of affairs the fusion with Piedmont is impossible, but they pretend
to want it (and voted <em>unanimously</em> for it only yesterday),
because it is for the present the only straightforward way of
avoiding a relapse into the clutches of the Grand Duke and
his myrmidons. In fact, when they had a chance of accomplishing
the fusion, although they were advised to take advantage
of it, they neither did so nor even desired it. Their own
Ambassadors in Paris and London (Peruzzi and Lajatico) put
it on one side, advancing instead a number of <em>schemes</em> and
solutions, commencing with a Prince of the House of Savoy
and finishing with Prince Leuchtenberg. The <cite>Times</cite> published
the document, the <cite>Augsburg Gazzette</cite> has repeated it with
evident satisfaction, and they have not denied it.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lajatico (as you tell me) now writes in the same way as
Marliani—that is, for the formation of a single Assembly which
is to repeat the vote for annexation to Piedmont, forgetting
that Parma has no Assembly, and on account of the unfortunate
dissensions and paltry points of honour between the two rival
cities of that nutshell, poor Manfredi has been obliged to have
recourse to a <em>Plebiscite</em>; that, moreover, to escape from the
machinations of an Armelonghi, who wanted to supplant him,
he has been compelled to call upon Farini to act as Dictator,
For my own part, I think that henceforth neither Marliani,
nor Peruzzi, nor Lajatico, nor Linati will be able to persuade the
people or obtain the one single Assembly as proposed by you.
But even conceding that our respective friends fully approve,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>and supposing that everybody consents, also that there is an
unanimous declaration of the desire to become Piedmontese,
that Europe is called to witness it, and that a <em>sole</em> Regent is
appointed (a matter of considerable difficulty in view of the
passions, and ambition, and rivalry, and suspicion aroused),
and conceding, moreover, that everything should go on according
to a preconceived idea, let us see what would in all
probability occur in actual <em>practice</em>.</p>

<p class='c018'>Your dilemma is this: by such an arrangement you either
succeed in convening an European Congress, which will deliberate
upon the present <em>abnormal</em> and disturbed condition of
central Italy, or the failure will at least be glorious. In the
first case, therefore, you only rest upon a hope, and a hope
that is evaporating daily, since France at heart does not <em>so far</em>
wish for the Congress, and I do not see who is to force it on
her.</p>

<p class='c018'>I must say that Lord John Russell’s noble declaration to the
effect that England does not intend to take part in any Congress,
unless the bases of peace and rearrangement of Italy are
different from those defined in the preliminaries at Villafranca,
so that room may be left for discussion, does great honour to
his high political capacity; but his declaration does not in the
smallest degree further the possibility of this European Congress,
particularly if it be borne in mind that those preliminaries
are now being reduced at Zurich, to a definitive peace
upon still more onerous conditions, and with the intervention
of Sardinia.</p>

<p class='c018'>The first part of the dilemma being disposed of, the second
remains. I fully agree that in fighting manfully the fall will
be glorious, but this glory will belong solely to the combatants,
and will redound to the perpetual ignominy of Piedmont,
which is condemned by some of its antecedents, and is
perhaps obliged by dire necessity to remain a quiet though
armed spectator of the struggle. The same Piedmont that has
nevertheless assumed the magnanimous task of the redemption
of Italy: that Piedmont which is the only State possessing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>backbone of national strength; that Piedmont which contains
in itself the fortunes of the Italy of the future, and to which we
must all at least give our moral support, so that it may not
utterly lose its reputation by too openly showing either its present
impotence or the paltriness of its policy of partial aggrandizement—a
policy which is, perhaps, a supreme necessity of
the novel <em>situation</em> wherein an imprudent peace has
placed it.</p>

<p class='c018'>But let us see whether there is not a third hypothesis besides
these two, and perhaps something even more probable, because
I consider it certain that Central Italy cannot <em>all</em> be annexed to
Piedmont, and likewise certain that France will not consent to
the forcible restorations.</p>

<p class='c018'>I maintain, in fact, that there will be no restorations at all,
and my opinion is not shaken either by Reiset’s journey or by
the mission of Poniatowski, nor even by the reception of one of
the fugitive Princes at the Tuileries. I hold that the Emperor
will permit the convocation of the Assembly devised by
you, exactly as he has allowed the gathering of the local Assemblies
and the record of their votes in favour of Piedmont.</p>

<p class='c018'>But will this fact create any necessity for a Congress?
Herein lies the essential part of it. You dare not make the
assertion, and I tell you most distinctly that the Congress will
never take place. But what will occur instead? Precisely
that which Napoleon is now preparing with so many twists and
turns—namely, the formation of a Central Italian State, of
which his cousin will be the monarch—a State that will be
located upon the two seas, and that will cut Italy in halves,
putting an end to all communication between the Sardo-Lombardian
States and that of the Two Sicilies, and excluding for
ever any hope of future aggrandizement.</p>

<p class='c018'>The means for arriving at this end are simple. He will
praise the high-minded proposal, but will lament its impracticability.
He will recall to mind the preliminaries of Villafranca,
and the consent that was given for the restorations, and
he will make it appear that those conditions can be modified in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>the Zurich negotiations (which depend solely upon him for
their continuance), but never in the sense of annexation to Piedmont.
He will have it whispered in the ears of those
in power that in order to elude the ravenous claws of
eaglets they will have to confide themselves to the care
of the Imperial Eagle. Montanelli and his set (who did not
abstain from voting for Piedmont without a reason) will then
come forward.</p>

<p class='c018'>They will have a long train of people prepared for the purpose,
and the Prince will be trumpeted forth from all corners.
They will demand universal suffrage, and Napoleon, son of
Jérome, will be hailed King of Etruria....</p>

<p class='c018'>Now, what am I to do in such a deplorable state of affairs?
Exiles in general are not treated with much consideration,
particularly when they want to give gratuitous advice.
Everyone naturally says, here is a man who was not able to
preserve his own country wanting, forsooth, to teach
others how to save theirs; and there are certain people
going about those provinces (especially some of my compatriots
with whom I should not like on any account
to be confused.) Altogether (take note of this) I am
suspicious of the very persons that I ought to see, and I
cannot trust the sincerity of their assurances. Besides Farini,
Minghetti, and Ricasoli (the three men upon whom things
entirely depend) have been already advised from your place,
and have received their instructions from Marliani and
Lajatico.</p>

<p class='c018'>My journey would create a heap of absurd rumours without
resulting in any advantage, seeing that I shall certainly not
succeed in persuading them, if they will not be persuaded, and
if, after all, they are already convinced, the trouble would go
for nothing.</p>

<p class='c018'>But to what conclusion does all this lead us?</p>

<p class='c018'>In Italy itself you will never be able to combat Napoleon’s
policy as long as Italy remains in its present condition—that
is to say, while he keeps Piedmont subject to continual pressure,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>occupies Lombardy with eighty thousand men, is the sole
arbiter of affairs in Zurich, holds the Pope with vain hopes in
a state of uncertainty, and caresses the Bourbons of Naples,
lending them courage to resist the representations of England.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was perhaps a great error to have invoked his aid at all,
and I do not intend to disguise the fact; but the error of the
Tory Cabinet in allowing him to come alone was certainly
greater. It is not now a question of expelling him, because
this could not be brought about without war, and everybody
has either had enough or is averse to it.</p>

<p class='c018'>It is merely a question of limiting his influence, in the same
way that the war was localised. We must give him a fragment
in order to save the remainder, strengthening this Subalpine
Kingdom and perhaps the Southern Kingdom too, at
the expense of the territory of the Pope, whose temporal
dominions cannot last any longer. But this Southern Kingdom
must cease to be the prey of a party that is so infamously reactionary,
and the civil government must be restored upon the
basis of true liberty. This particular change, which will infuse
new spirit into the life of Italy, is not difficult of attainment
<em>now</em> that the true Mayor of the Palace and virtual King is
Filangieri, a man of large and tractable conscience, if those
metallic wires which actuate it are properly manipulate.</p>

<p class='c018'>But all this cannot be originated in Italy. In order to
obtain such a result we must work elsewhere, and <a id='corr183.25'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='word'>work</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_183.25'><ins class='correction' title='word'>work</ins></a></span> with
all our might.</p>

<p class='c018'>A plan will be submitted to Lord John Russell by a person
who is <a id='corr183.28'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='exceeidngly'>exceedingly</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_183.28'><ins class='correction' title='exceeidngly'>exceedingly</ins></a></span> well versed in Italian affairs, and whose
political instincts are of the highest. This plan is admirable
in its simplicity, and not difficult to carry out if there be
hearty goodwill towards the work, and it be taken in hand at
once....</p>

Perhaps only when Italy shall have
given proof of her fitness to hold her
own amongst the Powers of Europe
will the chain of events which has
led to the accomplishment of Italian
Unity be fully appreciated. True, these events are
recent, and require the mellowness of time to impart
to them due historical importance. As time progresses,
however, the story of United Italy will attain
significance; and there is reasonable hope that the
new kingdom, hitherto not too harshly tried, will
also attain that healthy maturity of which its youth
has given promise. To forge the links to bind these
discordant States into one, wars, external or internal,
have succeeded each other; but, whilst assigning due
weight to fortune without, it would be ungracious to
stint the praise of the workers from within, whether
we regard the mild wisdom of the school of patriots,
whereof Poerio, Settembrini, and Panizzi were examples,
or the reckless valour of more ardent revolutionists,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>valour which, it must be granted, was not without its
uses when occasion demanded, and which in its excess
was skilfully controlled by one of whom it were but
faint commendation to say that amongst all the records
of eminent statesmen, his superior could not
easily be found.</p>

<p class='c018'>Our observations have shown that Panizzi did not
confine his love of country to that part of Italy
wherewith he himself was most intimately connected.
Having achieved his mission in favour of liberty in
the South, we now (1859) find him turning his attention
to the North of the Peninsula. By way of introduction
to our account of his proceedings in this
quarter, it may be well to give a short epitome of the
events of the year in question, when the first foundations
of Italian unity may be said to have been
laid.</p>

<p class='c018'>Victor Emmanuel, on succeeding to the throne in
consequence of his father’s abdication, enjoyed the
reputation of an experienced and intrepid soldier, yet
was not in other respects a general favourite with his
people. Nor was unpopularity at home the only difficulty
in his way. When, after the fatal day of Novara,
he received the crown from Charles Albert, who resigned
it not until he had vainly sought honourable
death in battle, he swore to avenge the wrongs of
Italy, and to uphold the free institutions of his own
realm. For this he had to reckon both with Austria
and Naples, who, with unparalleled effrontery, called
upon him to govern his kingdom in such a manner as
should be in conformity with the mode of government
in the other States of the Peninsula. To such a demand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>the King did not deign to listen, and his opponents
were forced to be content with denouncing
Sardinia as a hot-bed of sedition and revolutionary
agitation. In the beginning of 1859 Victor Emmanuel,
who, in his speech to Parliament, had remarked on the
threatening appearance of the political horizon, commenced
preparations for war against Austria. The
circumstances which precipitated the war are too fresh
in the recollection of our readers to be dwelt on here
to any length. Cavour, on the part of Sardinia, was
under promise to England to make no hostile demonstration
against Austria. France had declared that
she would aid Sardinia only in the case of the latter
being attacked. The preliminaries to an European
Congress were actually under discussion, when the
Emperor of Austria suddenly broke off all negotiations,
and demanded of Sardinia an immediate disarmament,
a summons which was treated by Cavour with contempt.
At this juncture, Austria, with that peculiar
aptitude for blundering which has so characterised her
action, sent, in the night of April 28-29, 1859, her
armies across the Ticino, thus affording an occasion of
action whereof the two allies were not slow to avail
themselves. The French troops hastened to cross the
Alps. Battle followed battle with uniform success to the
allied arms, when, like a thunderbolt, news of the Peace
of Villafranca fell on Europe. Unexplained at the time,
the reasons for it soon came within the range of tolerably
accurate conjecture. In the first place the eagerness
with which people of the other States in Italy prepared
to unite themselves with Sardinia (which Cavour
had foreseen, but which had failed to strike Louis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>Napoleon,) was hardly to the taste of the French
Emperor. Whatever were his objects in the war, the
unity of Italy was certainly not one of them. He had
employed his army, and thereby diverted his people;
he had gained a satisfactory amount of glory, though
perhaps not so much as his ambition led him to hope
for. In his victories, (though it were hard to apply to
them the epithet <em>Pyrrhic</em>,) he had undoubtedly sustained
greater loss than his adversary; and he possibly
thought it as well to refrain from following the Austrians
to the strong position to which they had retired,
and from whence not all the armies of Italy, Sardinia,
and France united could in all probability have succeeded
in dislodging them. His fortitude and forbearance
were, however, as all know, not without
their substantial reward.</p>

<p class='c018'>It is ours, not to write history, but simply to supply
aid to its study; and these may, we hope, be afforded,
to the reader by the somewhat varied correspondence
of which this chapter will mainly consist. The several
writers quoted are at any rate worth listening to, and
not least among them Luigi Carlo Farini, the Dictator,
well-known as the friend of Mr. Gladstone, a
letter from whom (dated March 18th, 1859) comes first
in order on our list:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c018'>“... Times are so serious that my mind is
filled with anxious thoughts. Yesterday the Austrians
blew up the bridge at Buffalora. It is all very
well for our friend Hudson to say they will not attack
us, but surely they strike us in our honour by violating
our property with their treaties.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>“I should like to see what John Bull would do if
they attempted to mine his house. Even yesterday
they expelled from Milan one of our most esteemed
staff-officers, Cav. Incisa. Such acts are committed
daily, but we must console ourselves by seeing how
the whole of Italy is giving a new and great example
of unity and strength. Ten thousand volunteers are
coming from all parts of Italy; it is a crusade; <em>your</em>
Modena has sent more than all the other States, considering
its extent (a thing which cannot be seen
without emotion). The stupefied Governments have
lost strength. National rights reign supreme in
public opinion. My dear friend, awful events are at
hand. We count much upon your advocating our
cause in England.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“The noble Neapolitan exiles, for whom the English
people so justly feel, may prove the means of advancing
the common cause. Let them only say that Neapolitan
tyranny is not of native, but of foreign growth,
and in order to chastise Bomba, it will be necessary to
chastise Vienna. Let us hope they may say so, for it
is the unvarnished truth.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>That Panizzi rated the strength of Austria and the
Quadrilateral at its proper value, and considered that
the Italians were about this time <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in trepidis rebus</i></span>, is
plain from the following letter to Mr. Haywood. It
bears no date, but evidently must have been written
(from the British Museum) just before the conclusion
of the war:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“These Italian affairs have, as you may suppose,
made me feverish. First of all, I think the Austrians
are not quite done for yet, although I think they will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>be. Even in these times of wonder I don’t believe
they can have lost Vicenza and Mantua, and if the
whole country is not really up, the King of Piedmont
will find these two very hard bits. That they are yet
in the Austrians’ hands I argue from the fact of
Radetzky’s troops retiring in two columns towards
them—what is more, taking with him political prisoners,
which shows he is not quite defeated. Even
when Mantua and Piacenza are taken, there is the
pass of Caldiero, fortified in an awful manner, as I
have seen myself, and such fortresses as Legnano,
Peschiera, and Verona, in which fifty thousand men
can defy three times the number.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“If the Tyrolese are up to the whole of the Venetian
territory, the Austrians may find it awkward, as
they are out of favour here, and they may not have
either time or the means of victualling their forces.
But between us I do not very much like the peasants
to take up arms in earnest, even if they join in a
popular movement at first. They must enrol themselves,
and that I do not think they will do. I foresee,
therefore, great difficulties, and at all events great
fighting. Yes, and depend upon it the French, if
they last as a republic, or even have a Bonaparte, will
interfere. As to myself, what can I do? I am more
than fifty, and not a soldier, and what they want now
are young men ready to shoulder a musket or to
command.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“In the second place, I am almost certain that the
Italians will differ among themselves (not as to the
Austrians, or as to being dismayed, but as to the form
of Government.) The King of Sardinia had no chance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>to keep his crown but by acting as he has done, as
they would have proclaimed a republic in Lombardy
with the help of the Swiss, and he would have had a
revolution in the same sense at home. But the spirit
of the ‘Giovine Italia’ is at work there, and I think
there will be yet a great deal of trouble before the
form of government is settled. My views you know,
and I fear I should have no one listening to me, and
the utmost I could expect would be to be looked upon
as a crazy Angloman. In the third place, I have
hardly any friend alive who would care for me, or on
whom I could have influence. I am a greater stranger
in Italy than here.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Towards the middle of the year, Panizzi himself
visited the scene of action, whence he wrote a graphic
account of affairs in the North of Italy to Mr. Gladstone,
in a far more cheerful tone than that of the last
letter quoted:—</p>

      <div class='line in2'>September 4th, 1859.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>“My dear Sir,—</p>

<p class='c019'>... I went to Bologna to see the opening
of the Assembly last Thursday, and I hope to give them some
good advice as to the wording of the resolutions which are to
be proposed to-morrow, proclaiming the independence of
Romagna. On Thursday I shall go to Parma again to assist
at the opening of their Assembly. I am now staying with
some distant cousins at a villa which Ariosto, who lived here,
had celebrated.</p>

<p class='c018'>I cannot tell you how gratified I am at what I have seen
ever since I came to this part of Italy, on Monday last. The
order and quiet which prevail everywhere are only equalled by
the unanimity with which every man, woman, and child is
determined not to submit again to the fallen Government. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>am happy to see that the determination is supported by large
numbers of volunteers who flock to enlist: they come not only
from the towns but from the country; and at night, since I
have been here, I have heard a variety of songs in dialect in
praise of Garibaldi and his soldiers, ridiculing the Austrians
and the late Duke of Modena, in very expressive although in
not very polite terms. I have seen persons who are well
affected to the Duke—the cousins at whose house I am staying,
and to whose family the Archbishop of Modena belongs,
amongst them—and one and all say that a restoration of the
fallen dynasty would be a great calamity. Here, in fact—at
Parma as well as Bologna—the universal wish is to be united
to Piedmont. The organization of the recruits proceeds with
the greatest rapidity, and the instructors (old soldiers) are
struck by the military qualities displayed by the population.
The Republican and Mazzinian agents are secreted everywhere;
still I think that the only danger to be feared is that if things
were to continue long in this state of suspense, with hardly any
Government in fact, anarchists might cause mischief, although
not triumph ultimately.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I have just heard that
the Austrians, most of them

gathering their forces to

</div>

<p class='c018'>Amongst the numerous
letters in our possession,
written by Count
Cavour to Panizzi, the
most important and interesting,
and at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>same time the most truly characteristic, both in form
and substance, of the great Statesman, is one dated
the 24th of October, 1859. It was written from
Leri, Cavour’s country seat. Thither he had,
immediately after the war, retired for a time
from public life, and with a heavy heart; for
the obscurity in terms and apparent treachery of
the Peace of Villafranca, had affected him with a torturing
suspicion that he had been betrayed. It is
something of a tribute to Cavour’s greatness that
Rattazzi, who succeeded him, was fain, in his embarrassment
in carrying on the Government, to seek the
counsel of his predecessor, the flame of whose
patriotism (however deeply wounded his own feelings
may have been) burnt as brightly in his retirement as
in office, as it needs but the following letter to
show:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“Leri, October 24th, 1859.</div>

<p class='c018'>“My dear Panizzi,</p>

<p class='c019'>Your letter of the 17th inst. was only delivered
to me yesterday, too late for me to answer it then. I hasten to
do so this morning, though I fear that my reply can hardly
reach London before the question of the Congress shall have
been decided.</p>

<p class='c018'>In the present state of affairs, considering the engagements
entered into at Villafranca and to a certain extent confirmed at
Zurich by the Emperor, it appears evident to me that an
European Congress is indispensable. Were there to be no
Congress, and were France to prevent the egress of Central
Italy from the provisional condition by opposing the stipulated
fusions, those countries would be exposed to serious dangers.
The eminent men in the Romagna—and there are many such
there—might incite Garibaldi to attempt an enterprise in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>Marches and perhaps even in the Abruzzi; at Modena the
occupation of the trans-Padan Mantuan territory by Austria—an
inevitable consequence of the treaty—might give rise to
lamentable collisions; Tuscany perhaps might be more patient
of an uncertain condition, but even there the intrigues of the
reactionaries supported by the priests would probably be the
cause of serious perturbations. Hence the interests of Italy
absolutely require a Congress, and, if this is plain, England
should participate therein both for her own honour and for our
benefit. Austria will not oppose her intervention, but will
accept her reservations when it is stipulated that nothing is to
be said about the provinces retained under Austrian dominion.
It is hard for us to renounce a plea in favour of unhappy
Venice; still we must repress our deep sympathies for fear of
sacrificing the possible for the desirable.</p>

<p class='c018'>Austria, relieved of apprehension respecting Venice, ought
to concur in the English maxim that the wishes of the Italians
should be respected. To put this in more diplomatic form it
would be sufficient to say that the Powers undertake not to
impose by force of arms any form of Government on the
people of Central Italy. This is the principle of non-intervention
already proclaimed by the Emperor in his writings and in
his speeches. Supported by France and by England, and perhaps
by Russia too, it will soon be admitted by Austria and
accepted by Prussia.</p>

<p class='c018'>Passing on to the constitution of the Congress, I do not
hesitate to declare for the exclusion of the minor Powers. If
only the Duchies and Tuscany were concerned their intervention
would be advantageous; but as the most difficult—I will
say too the most important question—is that of the Romagna
provinces, I fear the Pope would find vehement defenders in
Spain and in Portugal.</p>

<p class='c018'>The Congress once assembled, there can be no doubt as to
the course of England. She would first of all propose that
the wish of the people legally expressed should receive the
sanction of Europe. Supposing this proposition to be rejected,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>the next would be that the people be consulted by means of
universal suffrage, to be verified by the members of the Congress.
This proposal would find support in France, and would
probably be accepted. If it were not, England would have
to enter into a negative phase, and to withstand the proposals
of Austria and that of France too. The Duke of Modena
being abandoned by every one, even his own relations, there
will be nothing to oppose but the restoration of the House of
Lorraine in Tuscany, the installation of the Duchess of Parma
at Modena, and the re-establishment of the Papal dominion
in the Romagna provinces.</p>

<p class='c018'>Such resolutions as these may be resisted, not only on the
ground of the popular rights, but also, and still more efficaciously,
in the interest of the monarchical principle, and with
reference to ideas of order and stability. Unless we wish to
see the now stifled revolution revive, menacing and powerful,
it must not be confronted by feeble Governments without root
in the soil, destitute of both physical and moral force. If we
wish to see thrones respected, we ought not to fill them with
despised and despicable princes, whose very names are in irritating
antagonism to the sentiment—the national sentiment—now
dominating in Italy. If the Grand Duke or his son
return to Florence, then, in less than a month, Tuscany will
be the head quarters of Mazzini and of the belligerent revolution.
Perhaps it will be said that the Duchess or Parma is a
strong-minded woman, and is not unappreciated. However
this may be, the so hateful remembrances of the father could
not be effaced, nor could confidence be inspired in the son.
Besides, the system of compensations which some would wish
to apply in favour of this branch of the Bourbon family is in
direct collision with the sentiments and the ideas which now
prevail in Europe. The Modenese would be smitten in their
dignity if they found themselves allotted by way of jointure
to the widow of that rascal, the petty Duke of Parma. Better
for them the restoration of their former Sovereign. In that
case they would be victims of a false principle; but they would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>not be treated as a flock of sheep, disposed of as a counterbalance
for conditions deemed onerous by one of the contracting
parties.</p>

<p class='c018'>The Treaty of Vienna is odious enough in many parts; but
it is not so odious as that of Campoformio.</p>

<p class='c018'>With regard to the Romagna provinces, it will be easy for
England to get the idea of papal reforms scouted. To entertain
such an idea is worse than hateful—it is ridiculous. There
is no need to be either a great statesman or a great theologian
to feel convinced that the Pope not only does not wish but
really cannot consent to serious reforms. So long as he is
Pope and King he must in conscience employ the powers of
the King to enforce the decrees of the Pontiff. The separation
of the two authorities is impossible. The Pope cannot
consent to the freedom of instruction, nor to the freedom of
public worship, nor to the freedom of the press. He cannot
tolerate municipal freedom unless this be understood as an
authority of the Town Councils to regulate at will the public
roads and the manner of paving them. The Pope as Pope will
more easily submit to the loss of a province than to the promulgation
of the Napoleonic Civil Code in his States. The
Papal restoration ought to be prevented at every cost: it is
not only an Italian question, but one of European interest.
It concerns us, but it also concerns England, Prussia, even
Russia, and all countries where the development of civilization
is an object, for this requires as an essential condition the absolute
separation of the two Powers. If the Pope should obtain
a victory in Italy, the presumption and the pride of the Cullens
and the McHales would swell beyond bounds, and Europe
would be menaced before very long with the danger of religious
struggles similar to those of past ages. Let everything
be given up rather than sacrifice the Romagna provinces.
Their cause is, I say again, the cause of civilization.</p>

<p class='c018'>If England should succeed in warding off the Austro-French
proposals, let her reproduce those which she originally brought
forward: and if these do not prevail, let her propose the immediate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>union of Parma and Carrara with Piedmont, and the
establishment of a Government, provisional but strongly constituted,
to rule over Florence, Modena, and Bologna.</p>

<p class='c018'>These are my views: take them for what they are worth.
Far away from the turmoil of affairs, and having but slight
relations with the Ministers, I am probably unaware of many
things which might modify my opinion. Still, judging the
question of Central Italy from the data which history in some
way impresses upon our minds, I am strongly of opinion that
if England were to follow the part which I have traced, she
would succeed in the object of assuring the destinies of Central
Italy to our advantage and her own glory. Farewell, my
dear friend. Continue the advocacy of our cause before the
noble English nation, and your efforts will not be fruitless. I
say again now what I said to the Chamber and to Italy in
February—the statesmen who have ennobled their career by
accomplishing the emancipation of the negroes will not bear
the condemnation of Italy to eternal slavery.<a id='rG' /><a href='#fG' class='c015'><sup>[G]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>The next letter to Mr. Ellice (to whom, as there

he never lost an opportunity of communicating both
the intelligence he received and his own comments
and opinions <a id='corr197.24'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='theron'>thereon</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_197.24'><ins class='correction' title='theron'>thereon</ins></a></span>) is lively and amusing, and contains
much matter within a small compass. The observations
on the Rattazzi Government probably in no
wise exaggerate its defects:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“B. M., October 29th, 1859.</div>

<p class='c018'>... I can tell you for certain there will be a
Congress about Italy in which England will take
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>part. The Emperor of the French feels he is in a
scrape, and urges England to help him out of it, and
our Government are inclined to help him under
certain conditions, England wanting him in return on
some other account. He has accepted as explicitly
as possible England’s terms, and hitherto he has kept
his word to her; if he does not break it, the Government
are quite satisfied that all will go well for Italy.
Indeed, if England and France act together, there is
no doubt their policy must prevail.”</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c018'>“As to the Italians themselves, there is too much
softness in Piedmont on the part of the Government;
the King is the only man who dares; his Ministers
are miserable little bureaucrats. We must have a
change there, and Cavour must come back; and this
is what our Ministers wish. The people of central
Italy, who have given themselves up so heartily to
Piedmont, are tired of the prudence of the King’s
Government, which does nothing for them, and there
is great fear that they may break loose, and, taking
the matter in their hands, rush on the Pope’s soldiers
or the Rubicon, whom they will rout to a certainty.
The whole of the Umbria and the Marches will rise
at once; they have been quite ready to do so for two
months past, and it is with difficulty they are kept
quiet. If they rise, and the soldiers of central Italy
(Garibaldi is to lead them) rush in, you may be
certain that the kingdom of Naples will be in a
flame. Garibaldi with ten thousand men, Romagnuoli,
will conquer the whole kingdom down to Reggio.
The proclamations of Garibaldi, which you will have
seen two days ago in the papers, are ominous. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>Italy I did my best to keep him quiet, and so did
other friends; but I now see he is taking the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>mord
aux dents</i></span>, and no wonder. The King of Sardinia
has sent for him, but as he is no longer in his service
it is thought he may, under some pretext or other,
respectfully decline the summons. A revolution at
Naples, or its invasion by Garibaldi, would just now
be very disagreeable to the English Government, as
the question of change of government, both in the
kingdom of Naples proper and in Sicily, might be
brought on the tapis, and then you easily foresee a
great imbroglio—greater than any that has hitherto
taken place, as far as English interests are concerned.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“I understand the ministers are quite united with
each other, and all pleased with Lord Palmerston, of
whom Mr. Gibson has spoken to a friend of mine
not long ago. Lord Palmerston and Lord John are
particularly united together; this I know from the
latter. Gladstone, I am also told, runs quite straight.
The Court is quite Austrian, and, were it not for fear
of this trio, would probably try the Tories again.
There is a conspiracy of crinolines in favour of the
Duchess of Parma, the Empress of the French, and
the Queen of Spain. The latter wanted to send ten
thousand men to assist the Pope, but France and
England have put a veto on that.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>This may be fitly succeeded by two more letters from
Panizzi to Mr. Ellice. To each reader’s judgment and
discretion may fairly be left the decision whether the
historical parallel in the second of these is thoroughly
correct, and whether either Elizabeth or Cromwell had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>much notion of religious liberalism, or defended Protestantism
on the ground of its being the liberal
religion.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“B. M., January 4th, 1860.</div>

<p class='c018'>“... All the diplomacy in the world will not
bring back either those d—d Dukes or the Pope, and
the provinces whence they have been expelled. If
Napoleon sticks to the point of not allowing any
<em>armed</em> intervention in their favour, the legitimate
Sovereigns are dished. But, it is said, he has some
interested motive if he act so. I suppose he has; so
much the better if his interests coincide with the
interests and wishes of Italy. It is a pity no one else
has the same interest; but, if no one will do the
trick, even he is welcome. I see that after all he is
the only one who does something for that country.
If the Pope and Austrian influence are done for, what
is to come after it is of less importance. If the European
powers will aid and abet Austria in keeping
Venice, and in preventing a united kingdom of North
Italy being formed under Victor Emmanuel, I am
sorry for it, but they cannot complain if Plonplon is
preferred by the Italians to the Austrian and priestly
tyranny. Better Austria than the Pope, but better
Plonplon than either. That is the scale.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“... How could you suppose that I ever
could have said that Elizabeth and Cromwell interfered
to support <em>Catholicism</em>? My answer was, and
is, this:</p>

<p class='c018'>“Europe is now in about the same state with
respect to politics as it was in Elizabeth’s and Cromwell’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>times as to religion. These two personages did
not follow the policy which is now so much praised of
taking no side with either party, but showing the
greatest indifference to right or wrong. England, I
think, has not reached the lofty station it now occupies,
by adopting this policy; nor will she keep that
position by such means.</p>

<p class='c018'>“In the same manner that Elizabeth and Cromwell
took the side of liberalism in religion (Protestantism)
England ought now to take the side of liberty in
politics, and she would thus rise still higher.</p>

<p class='c018'>“In 1848 England allowed liberty to be crushed
everywhere; she even allowed Russia to lend an army
to Austria to crush an old and constitutional kingdom.
See how the Protestants are now treated all over the
Austrian Empire; how the Jesuitical party is rampant
in Germany and in Ireland; how Europe is crouching
to Napoleon. Is this to the advantage of free Protestant
England?</p>

<p class='c018'>“Now, suppose, instead of proclaiming her determination
to keep aloof (which neither Elizabeth nor
Cromwell would have approved) the Government of
Queen Victoria has told Russia and Austria that if
Despots were to join to crush liberty, free governments
would support those who tried to recover their
freedom, do you think England would now be worse
off?</p>

<p class='c018'>“If, instead of cheering Austria on to crush little
Piedmont, whose great crime was to support the
principles of civil and religious liberty, England had
stood by those principles as she ought, do you think
Napoleon would now stand as high as he does?</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>“Austria would never have dared to act as she did,
had she not been encouraged by the then English
Government; and the war which has given Savoy and
Nice to France would never have taken place if
England had done something for the cause of freedom.
That position which now Napoleon occupies would
have been occupied by England to her manifest advantage,
and to that of mankind.</p>

<p class='c018'>“When the Protestants were hard pushed at La
Rochelle, Elizabeth did not stand by looking on, nor
did her Parliament talk so much as ours does. When
the poor Vaudois were persecuted by the Duke of
Savoy, Cromwell was not so squeamish about non-intervention,
but sent word to Mazarin to make the
Duke understand that the persecution <em>must</em> cease—and
it did cease.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Compare those times with ours, and then laugh, if
you can, at my political notions. When do you
return?”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>Two months after the date of the last-quoted letter,
Panizzi received an interesting account of Southern
Italy from Poerio, which is subjoined:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“Turin, June 1st, 1860.</div>

<p class='c018'>“My dearest Friend,</p>

<p class='c019'>While I have been waiting for an answer to the
letter which I wrote to you from Florence, new and unexpected
events and new complications have arisen, demanding
the prompt and energetic co-operation of everybody who is
devoted to our cause.</p>

<p class='c018'>Therefore I am forced to have recourse to you as one of
those few who, to a fixed determination of aiding their country,
add by their own personal importance the capacity of doing
good upon an extensive scale.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>Palermo has fallen, and the National idea is triumphant
throughout the island.</p>

<p class='c018'>Of course there are many obstacles to be overcome. Nevertheless
before long that noble region will be irrevocably lost to
the Bourbons, and regained for Italy. But what will become
of the seven millions of Italians who still groan beneath the
detestable tyranny of the Bourbons? It is now said that the
Government, in order to gain time (as it did in 1848) intends
putting on the mask of liberalism, and retains the Count of
Syracuse as the principal actor in this impudent farce. He
has a few adherents, and is not wanting in desire to represent
a Louis-Philippe in miniature.</p>

<p class='c018'>In the meantime the Mazzini set are agitating because they
know that of the whole Italian territory the Southern Provinces
of the peninsula are best adapted to their designs.</p>

<p class='c018'>Neither are the partisans of Murat standing idle, but are
working effectually in the army with the most seductive promises.</p>

<p class='c018'>Finally, there is the Subversive (Sanfedista) Party, of the
purest race, who would like to reserve for Naples the fate of
Palermo, and who have decided to put the whole country to
fire and pillage. You see, therefore, that there are four
parties, all fairly strong, and all hostile to the true National
Party, which solely desires the unity of Italy under the constitutional
sceptre of King Victor Emmanuel. Any one who
has any experience in political matters will easily understand
that for this National Party to engage in the struggle with any
hope of success it must be provided with ready means, otherwise
the remaining divisions will pre-occupy the field, and the
country, after going through twelve years of the most cruel
despotism, will fall into civil war, and thence into the most
frightful state of anarchy. The danger is imminent, and the
remedy must be prompt. The numbers who have decided to
undertake the enterprise amount to several thousands; but the
pecuniary resources are most limited. Besides, it must be
borne in mind that if delay is disastrous, to enter upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>task with insufficient means would be still more so, since a
failure would lend strength to a detested Government, which
is now tottering under the weight of its crimes, and which
could never stand against a well-supported effort. In this
state of affairs your political friends, of whom you have so
many in that noble country, ought not to let slip this favourable
occasion for assisting us—an opportunity which cannot
again present itself, and of which others will avail themselves,
to the eternal prejudice of Italy, unless steps be taken in time
to prevent it. Nor do I think that they ought to be influenced
by certain restricted views which several of them wish to put
forward.</p>

<p class='c018'>The only solution of the question is really the <em>Italy of the
Italians</em>, which, far from compromising the peace of Europe,
would serve to consolidate it by removing a continued incentive
to foreign ambition. Once decide upon a policy of non-intervention,
and the struggle between the two principles in
Italy can neither be long nor sanguinary.</p>

<p class='c018'>The liberal party in Europe will then count one more truly
independent state, which will make its principles respected,
and will certainly contribute both to their triumph and to the
general development of civilization.</p>

<p class='c018'>The Bourbons will be crushed, and to the great benefit of
every one, since their detestable Government is incompatible
with Italian independence. The most disastrous error of the
times would be that of wishing to maintain them on the throne
at any cost, because it would outrage the moral sense of the
whole of Italy. Neither do I see the necessity of supporting
and bolstering up a race which is the very incarnation of perjury.
If the Bourbons were to remain in Naples, even with a
fictitious constitution, they would sooner or later be supplanted
by a Napoleonic régime.</p>

<p class='c018'>Enthusiasm evaporates in time; but if we now follow up
this terrible current which urges the main stream, Italy can be
rendered free and united. If, however, the opportunity is
allowed to pass, dualism, with all its terrible consequences, will
be the result.</p>

<p class='c018'>While on the subject of Southern Italy we may
remind our readers that there has been frequent
mention made above of a gentleman, who, as a constant
friend and correspondent of Panizzi, and as a
prominent personage in Neapolitan matters, demands
some further notice. Mr., afterwards Sir James
Lacaita, was, previously to the year 1850, legal adviser
to the British Legation at Naples. In this position,
by his great official capacity, and by his well-proved
exemplary character, he succeeded in gaining the
friendship of Sir William Temple. He had the
further good fortune to make the acquaintance of
Mr. Gladstone, at the house of Lord Leven, who was
spending a winter at Naples. This acquaintance soon
ripened into intimacy, a consequence which was almost
a matter of course, for Lacaita was well fitted to win
the confidence and attract the liking of those who,
themselves possessed of merit, could discover and
value merit in others. Endowed with distinguished
abilities, and a master of the English language;
in political matters of sound and matured
judgment, and (as will hereafter be seen) of unassailable
honour and integrity; such very exceptional
characteristics soon marked him out for invidious distinction
by the partisans of King Bomba. On the 26th
of December, 1850, he was arrested in the street as a
dangerous person and thrown into prison. All his
papers were ordered to be examined in his presence;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>but, Sir William Temple having requested the
“Attaché” of the Legation, Mr. Fagan, to claim as
many of these as possible in the name of Her Britannic
Majesty’s Government, a large proportion was
thereby saved.</p>

<p class='c018'>A certain note, however, which originated in a
mere joke, was detained, and turned out to be the
innocent cause of serious trouble. Previously to his
arrest, Lacaita, in conjunction with Lord and Lady
Leven and their three daughters, had planned a tour
for eight days to La Cava, Salerno and Amalfi. In
sportive mood it was laid down by the “tourists” that
no authority of one over the other was to be recognised
amongst the members of this party, and to distinguish
nominally the perfect freedom and equality of the
society, they dubbed themselves the “Republic.” It
must have been with mingled feelings of indignation
and gratification that the police discovered amongst
the confiscated papers a note written by Lady Anne
Melville, after the return from the tour, containing
the words, <em>Will you come to tea, and talk over the
grand Republican days?</em> In vain was it explained to
the authorities that the note had no political significance,
but the suspicious adjective was merely playful
reference to the little temporary republic of “tourists,”
and to no dangerous revolutionary organisation.</p>

<p class='c018'>Either lacking a natural sense of humour, or holding
jocosity to be impossible in so grave a matter as
anything <em>Republican</em> in the then state of Italian
politics, they altogether rejected this, to them, fanciful
interpretation. The letter was registered (it is still in
the archives of the Criminal Court of Naples), and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>formed one of the chief grounds for the charge of
sedition and conspiracy brought against Lacaita.</p>

<p class='c018'>In the summer of 1860, Cavour, well aware of the
negotiations that were being carried on between
England, France and Naples, and desirous of obtaining
some trustworthy person to watch his interests, and
supply him with information—and being, moreover,
unable, for reasons which may be easily understood,
to charge his own Minister, the Marquis d’Azeglio,
with the mission—applied to Lacaita, who, on receiving
the message, although laid up with severe illness,
immediately rose from his bed and went straight to
Lord Russell’s house. His Lordship, having an
engagement with the Neapolitan Minister, had given
direction that no person whatever should be admitted.
Sir James, however, being intimate with the family,
managed to see his Lordship, and was able there and
then to turn the current of affairs in a totally different
direction, and to prevent the French Ambassador
Count Persigny, and his Neapolitan colleague
the Marquis La Greca, from carrying out their plans.
Had it not been for Sir James Lacaita’s prompt and
skilful intervention, England would doubtless have
been remitted to the position she had held in 1848.</p>

<p class='c018'>Nothing now remained to those whom Lacaita had
thus thwarted but to win him over to the side of
Francis II., and this it was thought might be effected
by offering him the post of Minister at the Court of
St. James’s, in the room of Count Ludolf. The chief
instrument employed for the conversion of this dangerous
opponent was Signor Giovanni Manna, the Neapolitan
Minister of Finance, who was now at Paris,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>whither he had been sent to negotiate a loan. Manna,
who was a personal friend of Lacaita’s, started from
Paris in August with the sole object of persuading
him to accept the offer; holding out as a further inducement
to a change of opinion a considerable bonus,
besides a not insignificant salary and the title of
Marquis, which might well be regarded as superseding
the inferior rank of knighthood which had already
been conferred upon him.</p>

<p class='c018'>The unification of Italy was regarded by most politicians
of the time, Lacaita included, as, to say the least
of it, a remote possibility. To the King’s offer, and the
numerous advantages accompanying it, Lacaita simply
replied, <em>This is bribery</em>. In this conclusion he was supported
by the advice of two distinguished statesmen,
Lord Lansdowne and Mr. Gladstone, and by a letter
from Panizzi (dated Homburg, 23rd of August, 1860),
which did not reach him until a few days after his
refusal of the post:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“... I willingly comply with your request, and
frankly give you the advice which you ask on the point
which you truly describe as delicate and knotty—that
is, whether you ought to accept the appointment as
Minister of His Sicilian Majesty at the Court of St.
James’s.</p>

<p class='c018'>“As Minister of that King you must first of all
oppose the enterprise of Garibaldi, who wishes to
unite the whole of Italy under one sole head, and if
that head should be Victor Emmanuel, you, Sir James
Lacaita, would have to support an abominable and
cruel scion of an execrated race against the only
Sovereign who has shown that he is an Italian; in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>fact, you would have to help in cutting up Italy. I
do not presume to judge those gentlemen who have
undertaken to serve his said Neapolitan Majesty; but
they were on the spot, had served—at least some of
them—the dynasty, and perhaps had not duly considered
before they accepted their posts. But are you,
who are free, and in your sober senses, to serve a Bourbon
like him of Naples? Are you to stand by the side
of those who proclaimed martial law?—you to join a
Government which now shoots down the noblest
Italians who have liberated Sicily from a detested
yoke? No one <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>cui sanum sinciput</i></span> can believe that
the King of Naples is to be trusted, when he gives
utterance to the sentiments which he now pretends to
profess, and every one who is not bereft of sense knows
and feels that the man is still the faithful and true ally
of Austria, the tool of the harsh stepmother, the blind
and abject slave of the priesthood which has made
Rome a sewer. And would you give your honoured
name, your influence, your talents to a man without
affection and without faith like that King? My dear
Lacaita, that name, that influence, those talents
belong to Italy and to an honourable King, not to a
schismatic party—not to a perfidious and treacherous
perjurer.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I use strong expressions: the case justifies them.
You may show this letter of mine to any one you
please, and tell what I think without any reserve
whatever!...”</p>

<p class='c018'>In September, 1860, Panizzi paid another visit to
Italy, of which, and of the condition of affairs in that
country, he gave an account in the two following
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>extracts from letters to Mr. Ellice, written after his
return.</p>

<p class='c018'>Some remarks on the evil which Garibaldi’s mistaken
zeal was likely to produce on the state of Rome
and on the French Emperor are well worth reading.
The “confabulation” with the King at Turin, mentioned
in the first letter, at which Cavour was present,
was held in a stable with great secrecy. Only such
passages are given as bear most directly on the history
of the time:—</p>

<div class='c011'>“B. M., Oct. 5, 1860.</div>

<p class='c018'>“... I have seen and had long confabulations
with the King at Turin, and with the Emperor
at Paris. I can tell you that Garibaldi, who seemed
to have lost his senses, and who was surrounded by a
set of scamps who made a fool and tool of him, honest
fellow! will by this time have made an <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>amende honorable</i></span>,
and submitted to the King, or be put down.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Be assured that Cavour and the rational party in
Italy (that is ninety-nine per cent. of the population)
are not such fools as to attack Austria. It is owing
to the threats of Garibaldi, the French Emperor
having undertaken to preserve from injury or insult
the person of the Pope, that the French garrison at
Rome has been increased. But that garrison will
not defend any part of the Papal territory except
what it actually occupies; and should the Pope leave
Rome, as he was on the point of doing ten days ago,
the French will withdraw, and the Sardinian army
occupy Rome.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The note or letter of Lord John to Cavour has
<em>disgusted</em> many and surprised all. I think it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>written of his own accord, and perhaps without the
knowledge of his colleagues. He who has been so
long a consistent friend of Italy write such a letter,
when the Government of the King of Sardinia was
supposed to be in difficulties, and was in fact so!
Those are the acts which make even the French Emperor
popular, and which, by encouraging the despotic
party in Germany, may kindle a war.... There
will be no anarchy in Italy, and the Emperor Napoleon
<em>may be relied on</em>.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Nothing serves more in France than English abuse.
Of this I am certain, and I have most curious proofs.
I am also positive that he is personally a firm friend
of England, and that he has more to do than people
suppose to quiet the <em>Anglophobia</em> of the French....
I had the pleasure of seeing prisoner of war at Turin,
that worthy companion in arms of Monsignor Lamoricière,
Monsignor Schmidt, he who butchered people
at Perugia where he was obliged to surrender at last.
It was delightful to see the provoking indifference
with which the Piedmontese looked at him....
Cavour wanted to make a present of several hundred
Irishmen taken prisoners to the English Government,
but the present was respectfully declined....”</p>

<div class='c011'>“B. M., Oct. 11th, 1860.</div>

<p class='c018'>“... I am astonished to see the Paris correspondent
of <cite>The Times</cite> allowed to write as he does
about the King of Sardinia and his Minister. His
misrepresentations are all directed to disparage them
all and so far favourable to Austria. In to-day’s
number that correspondent, in order to throw discredit
on Cavour’s statement, said that he was not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>to be believed, as he had asked <em>Savoy</em> although he
had promised not to give up any part of the Piedmontese
territory. The King is represented as
<em>swearing</em> and <em>mad</em> with rage whenever the cession
of Savoy is mentioned. Now I have spoken to the
King about this transaction, and have most respectfully
said things which were, from their nature,
calculated to irritate. The King was not irritated,
he was not in a rage, and did not swear; he spoke
with great moderation, and with great feeling. I
was struck with it....”</p>

<p class='c018'>Our budget of correspondence, which has been resorted
to more copiously than was at first intended,
may be closed, so far as this chapter is concerned, by
a letter from Panizzi to Mr. Gladstone, which is
given in its <a id='corr212.16'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='integrity'>entirety</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_212.16'><ins class='correction' title='integrity'>entirety</ins></a></span>:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“My dear Sir,</p>

<p class='c019'>Your letter has filled me with apprehension for
poor Italy, and with gratitude for your warm interest in her
cause. I felt reason daily to mistrust the conduct of my Paris
interlocutor, and I am the more afraid, seeing that you, too,
feel there is reason for mistrust. When the conduct of the
fleet at Gaeta was first known, I wrote to say that it was suspicious,
and at variance with recent professions. My letter
went through the Minister to St. Cloud, and I received from
my friend with whom the correspondence was carried on the
enclosed answer, which please return. Lord P. has seen it, but
no one else. I was not satisfied, and I wrote again to my
friend to say so, but he is not in Paris, and he had to send my
last letter from the country to Paris. He has since written
that the Minister would be glad to correspond chiefly with
me; but now he is out, and my communications are stopped.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>Nor do I know how I could reach St. Cloud without it being
known to many who ought not to know it. The appointment
of Walewski and that of Flahaut portend no good to Italy
and to the English alliance. If this interference by sea and
by land continue, it is evident that it is intended to allow a
civil war to kindle in Italy, to have a pretext for interfering,
not certainly for the good of the country. Is it possible that
the three Emperors and the supporters of the Pope and of despotism
in Germany have agreed to settle matters to their own
advantage, leaving Prussia, England, and Italy out? Allowing
Russia to act as she thinks best in the East, France on the
Rhine and in Italy, and Austria in the outer provinces of the
Turkish Empire, close to Hungary! It is an extravagant supposition,
but the conduct of France is still more so.</p>

<p class='c018'>The author is well aware that nothing short of his
long-standing intimacy with the subject of this
“Memoir” could justify the introduction into the
work of anything approaching egotism, unless it were
to illustrate an essential point in the character of
which he is treating; but in writing of the
year 1860, recollections crowd upon the memory
which he trusts his readers will excuse him for
committing to paper. In that same year he (then
a boy of thirteen) was sent, under the charge of a
Queen’s Messenger, from Naples to a school in
England. Arriving in London, he was most kindly
received by Panizzi, and well remembers his first interview
with one who was thenceforth to be his
staunchest friend. Not that this was the first time
that the latter had bestowed his good offices upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>family of the writer, whose eldest brother, now Major
Fagan, owes and acknowledges a debt of gratitude for
the kindness received at his hands in youthful days,
and up to the time of receiving his Commission and
starting for India in 1859.</p>

<p class='c018'>But pleasant and important as it would be, for
some reasons, to dwell upon many happy reminiscences
of uninterrupted intercourse with a pre-eminent
man, the task which is here undertaken leads
us to more serious matters relating to that period, and
that yet remain to occupy the space which should be
devoted rather to the information of our readers than

The formation of a new and extensive
kingdom, as might have been expected,
was a question of too deep
moment not to exercise an important,
though indirect influence on England’s
relations with States nearer and more powerful
than Italy. It is purposed in the present chapter
to deal with events more immediately affecting this
country rather than Italian politics. England, in
1859, did not occupy her former high and stable
position amongst the nations of Europe. Her late
struggle with Russia had taught her a lesson which
had not been neglected; she had gained strength it
is true, but not in such a degree as to render altogether
unwarrantable the disparaging taunts in
which certain foreign Statesmen indulged at her
expense. ‘Of a truth,’ says the prince of comic
writers, ‘wise folk learn a good many things from
their enemies’ (Aristophanes, The Birds 1, 387), and
well do the words apply to England, who then learnt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>wisdom from her foes. Bitter experiences in the
Crimea taught us the miserable insufficiency of our
military system, and already action had commenced
for future improvement. Regarding, not unreasonably,
with some feeling of alarm the threatening
aspect of Continental affairs, we had at last opened
our eyes to the knowledge that the dispersion of the
troops retained in the country over all parts of the
United Kingdom (and of these, many, in the sister
isle, employed on what may be considered as little
better than police duty) was not the policy most
adapted to secure home defence, or to maintain that
army in the fittest condition for service abroad. It
was in the year 1859 that the Volunteer force of
Great Britain, which, with the exception of one
solitary battalion, had been extinct since the beginning
of the century, was revived, or, to speak more
accurately, sprang up into a fresh existence: indeed,
in the succeeding year the movement acquired strength
so rapidly as to appear before the nation as an army,
imperfect naturally and undeveloped, but giving such
promises of efficiency as have since been so fully and
amply ratified.</p>

<p class='c018'>It is not our intention to enter on the subject of
reforms in the regular army which ensued, nor is
there any necessity to detail all the circumstances
which led England to turn her attention to her own
safety, and in the interests of this to set her house in
order. The causes for apprehension may have been
exaggerated, but that they were altogether without
foundation is incredible. It is indisputable that after
the cession of Nice and Savoy to the Emperor of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>French, disquieting rumours as to his further intentions
were afloat. His next project, it was said, was the
annexation of Geneva, and among other means of
aggrandisement which he contemplated, one was an
advance of the French frontier to the Ebro, in exchange
for which Spain was to receive aid and support
in the subjugation of Portugal. These designs
of the Emperor were not only freely discussed in
society, but set forth in pamphlets apparently stamped
with Imperial authority. Lord Palmerston watched
with much misgiving the great additional military and
naval preparations on the part of France, and to him
they were a source of grave anxiety; nor must these
rumours, magnified and distorted as they may have
been, be regarded by us with contempt, when it is
known that such keen observers, and acute politicians,
as the Prime Minister, Mr. Gladstone, and Panizzi
himself, viewed them with perturbed reflections.</p>

<p class='c018'>In this year (1860), Panizzi, for the first time, had
been invited by His Majesty Napoleon III. to spend his
holidays at Biarritz, in company with his old friend
Prosper Mérimée. Correspondence of much importance
is here adduced, and is given in full, as bearing
upon the suspicions and presages of evil already referred
to. The first letter in order is from the pen of Panizzi
to Mérimée, and from it may be gathered all that is
needful of the dreaded omens which threatened to
disturb the peaceful relations existing between
England and France, whose alliance involved the
peace of the whole civilized world, whilst its rupture
would throw broadcast the seeds of dissension and of
war. The letters themselves indicate the close relations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>between the two correspondents, and their
intimacy, will be reverted to hereafter:—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>“My dear Mérimée,</p>

<p class='c019'>... I have been so fortunate as to have
an opportunity of at once communicating to a very influential
personage the chief points of the conversation I had the honour
of holding with the Emperor respecting the want of cordiality,
not to say coolness, now unhappily prevailing between France
and England, my object being humbly to contribute, as far as
might be in my power, to the growth of better feelings. I
have dwelt on the earnestness with which His Majesty had
expressed himself with respect to the English alliance, and on
the warmth with which he had spoken of his affection for this
nation. I did not fail to repeat what His Majesty had said of
his consciousness of never having done a single act which
could be construed as injurious or even unfriendly to England;
of his feeling that he had most scrupulously fulfilled his duties
as an ally; of his having nothing so much at heart as to be on
the most intimate terms with this country, feeling confident
that that would be for the advantage of both France and England,
whilst it gave him, personally, heartfelt satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c018'>What I said was extremely well received, and the same
wish was expressed as that which had been expressed by His
Majesty, that the two countries should always act cordially
together; that His Majesty would find England most desirous
to cultivate an alliance so eminently advantageous to both
nations, provided that could be done without sacrifice to
England’s honour and interests, and that on this side of the
channel they were not aware of ever having given France any
just cause of complaint. But that many things created the
impression that France, not satisfied with the eminent position
in which she was placed, was striving to extend her influence
and possession beyond what was just and fair towards her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>neighbours. In support of this impression a great many facts
were alleged. It was stated that Savoy and Nice were annexed
not only against the most explicit professions to the
contrary, but on pretence that would justify any other annexation
of territories that France might covet. I was, moreover,
told that France, knowing how injurious it might be to
English interests to alter the territorial arrangements on the
coast of Barbary with reference to Gibraltar, had nevertheless
encouraged an unjust attack on the part of Spain or Morocco;
that France was favourable to the fall and partition of
the Turkish Empire, well-knowing that England would oppose
this consummation with all her might; that agents were
traced to Belgium and other parts, endeavouring to create a
party in those populations favourable to the annexation of
territories now belonging to other States, to France; that
agents had even been found at work in Ireland, that the number
of pamphlets published in France directed to prepare the
world for extensive territorial alterations in favour of an enlargement
of the French Empire, and the belief that many of
such pamphlets were published with the approbation, if not at
the instigation of the French Government, rendered them apparently
an indication of the intentions of that Government.
It is only necessary, in conclusion, to advert to the great, constant,
and progressive armaments of France, both by land and
by sea. As to the latter, Englishmen are convinced they
cannot be directed to any other end but eventually to offensive
warfare, especially against England. France, they say,
cannot want for any defensive purpose so large a navy as she
has, to which she is steadily adding; and it is obviously for
aggressive purposes that she drills her sailors and troops to embark
and disembark with rapidity and precision, and that she
builds vessels intended for the transport and landing of large
bodies of soldiers. It depends on France, I was told, to be on
the very best and most intimate terms with this country, that
is, by not acting in a manner which excites well-grounded
suspicions of her intentions. There is every disposition on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>the part of England to meet her more than half way, but if
the acts of the Imperial Government are not calculated to
inspire confidence, it will be impossible for England not to be
on her guard, and prepare herself for any contingencies. As
to the accusation that England encourages other powers to
coalesce to attack France, I am told it is utterly unfounded.
It is positively denied, moreover, that there is any intention
of forming any coalition, or even of coming to an understanding
for the purpose of injuring France. It is, however, admitted
that nations who watch the conduct of France are uneasy
for their own security, and that they will probably come
to some understanding should it ever come to pass that France
becomes aggressive.</p>

<p class='c018'>In conclusion, I was told, the peace of the world as well as
the happiness of mankind, is in the hands of France. If she
will not attempt to injure others, no one will think of injuring
her; and so far as England is concerned, if France will be
satisfied with what is fair and honourable, she may rely on the
sincere desire of this country of being on the best terms with
her, and of her acting accordingly.</p>

<p class='c018'>You are at liberty to show this letter to the Minister, and
even to place it in his hands should he wish to show it to his
august master, who ought to know exactly by what feelings
and motives political men are moved in this country towards
France.</p>

<p class='c018'>A good understanding with England must be of some value
to France. She has raised the storm; she must do her best
to allay it if she have at heart the English alliance.</p>

<p class='c018'>I hope you will be authorised to answer this letter in a
manner that will prepare the way to a lasting return of cordiality
on both sides.</p>

<p class='c018'>M. Mérimée’s reply partakes much of the style of
the special pleader. Whilst he strongly disclaims
his belief in the Emperor’s bad faith, as suggested by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>Panizzi, his defence of Louis Napoleon seems hardly inconsistent
with the truth of certain of the allegations.
He himself appears to have considered his criticism
of English policy the strongest point in his letter:—</p>

<div class='quote0' style='font-size:95%' lang='fr' xml:lang='fr'>

<div class='c011'>“Paris, Samedi 6 Octobre, 1860.</div>

<p class='c018'>“Mon cher Panizzi, ...</p>

<p class='c019'>En attendant, vous saurez que je ne suis revenu
de voyage que hier soir, où j’ai trouvé votre lettre. Je l’ai
portée ce matin chez Son Excellence. Je vois que les dispositions
de Lord Palmerston sont telles que je me les représentais,
c’est-à-dire le contraire de bienveillantes, mais je
ne me doutais pas qu’il <em>dit</em> la moitié des choses extraordinaires
qu’il vous a dites. Dans l’exposé de ses griefs il y a une
bonne partie de faussetés complètes auxquelles il n’y a qu’un
démenti formel à donner. Puis il y a des niaiseries que je ne
me serais jamais attendu à entendre dans la bouche d’un
homme d’Etat ou soit-disant tel. Par exemple, cette bonne
bêtise que la France médite une invasion en Angleterre, parce
que dans des ports de mer on exerce les soldats à embarquer
et débarquer promptement. Il me semble que, lorsque dans
l’espace de deux ans on a eu cent cinquante mille hommes à
débarquer en Italie, douze mille à débarquer en Chine, six
mille à débarquer en Syrie; quand, de plus, la plus importante
de nos colonies, l’Algérie a une armée de cinquante mille
hommes qui ne communique avec la France que par mer, il
me semble, dis-je, qu’il n’est pas inutile d’apprendre aux
soldats à entrer dans un vaisseau et à en sortir. Quant aux
armements, vous pouvez dire hardiment qu’il ne s’en fait point.
On donne des congés de semestre dans tous les régiments, et,
à mon avis, <em>on a tort</em>, attendu l’état des choses en Italie. Les
armements maritimes sont aussi faux que les préparatifs de
l’armée de terre. Si vous voulez lire la brochure que je vous
ai portée, vous verrez la vérité sur tout cela. Le pauvre
Louis-Philippe avait laissé dépérir la flotte. De plus on est
dans une époque de rénovation et il est nécessaire de transformer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>les bâtiments à voiles. Je conçois que l’Angleterre veuille
avoir le monopole de la mer, et qu’elle y tienne, mais elle
l’aura toujours, attendu qu’elle dispose d’un bien plus grand
nombre de marins que toute autre puissance. Nous avons eu
des escadres d’élite qui, sous les ordres d’un chef excellent
comme l’Amiral Lalande, auraient peut-être battu une escadre
Anglaise, mais si, en gagnant une bataille, nous perdions
mille matelots et les Anglais dix mille, nous ne
pourrions réparer notre perte, tandis qu’en un mois l’Angleterre
trouverait dix mille autres matelots aussi bons. Il me
paraît par trop bouffon de la part de Lord Palmerston de dire
que l’Angleterre ne cherche pas et ne cherchera pas à former
une coalition contre la France, et d’ajouter aussitôt que les
puissances inquiètes <span lang="en" xml:lang="en"><i>will probably come to some understanding</i></span>!
Une autre assertion non moins extravagante, c’est de nous
accuser d’avoir encouragé l’Espagne a faire la guerre au Maroc.
J’étais en Espagne au moment où cette guerre s’est faite, et
s’il y a à Madrid un ministre anglais avec des yeux et des
oreilles, il aurait pu dire que la guerre a été faite par l’explosion
du sentiment national, et que les lettres de Lord John
Russell ont eu pour résultat d’exalter ce sentiment et d’exciter
à la haine contre l’Angleterre. Il n’est pas moins étrange de
prétendre que la France qui a aidé l’Angleterre à retarder la
destruction de l’empire Ottoman, pousse maintenant à sa ruine.
Vos ministres sont comme les malades qui ne veulent pas que
leur médecin leur dise que leur état est grave. Ressusciter
ou même faire vivre longtemps la Turquie est impossible, et il
serait insensé de se quereller sur les remèdes à lui donner,
<a id='corr222.29'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='orsqu’il'>lorsqu’il</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_222.29'><ins class='correction' title='orsqu’il'>lorsqu’il</ins></a></span> faudrait au contraire s’entendre sur la manière de
l’enterrer. Que la France ait de l’ambition, je ne le nie pas.
C’est une idée ou plutôt un préjugé national, qu’elle s’est
amoindrie en perdant une partie des conquêtes de la révolution.
Je crois que l’Empereur ne partage pas ce préjugé,
mais, en tout cas, dans l’hypothèse qu’il l’aurait, vous ne le
supposez pas assez dépourvu de bon sens pour risquer d’avoir
toute l’Europe sur les bras, sur la chance d’ôter cent cinquante
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>mille âmes à la Bavière et autant à la Prusse? Ce que la
France gagnerait en étendue, elle le perdrait en homogénéité,
et, tout considéré, elle s’affaiblirait au lieu de prendre
des forces. Ce qui me frappe surtout dans la politique
anglaise de notre temps, c’est sa petitesse. Elle n’agit ni
pour des idées grandes, ni même pour des intérêts. Elle
n’a que des jalousies et se borne à prendre le contrepied
des puissances qui excitent ses sentiments de jalousie. Le
résultat est de diminuer son importance en Europe et de la réduire
au rôle de puissance de second ordre. En ménageant la
chèvre et le chou comme elle a fait, en observant la neutralité
peu impartiale entre l’Autriche et la France, elle n’a obtenu
l’amitié ni de l’une ni de l’autre. Y a-t-il quelque chose de
plus misérable que sa politique à Naples et en Vénétie? Comment
M. de Rechberg peut-il avoir la moindre confiance en
des gens qui encouragent Garibaldi et Kossuth et qui ne
veulent pas l’affranchissement de la Vénétie? Tout se fait en
Angleterre en vue de conserver des portefeuilles. On fait
toutes les fautes possibles pour conserver une trentaine de voix
douteuses. On ne s’inquiète que du présent et on ne songe
pas à l’avenir. Il est certain qu’il y a dans ce moment en
Europe un malaise général qui amènera une catastrophe et une
grande modification de la carte. Des hommes vraiment politiques,
voyant le mal, chercheraient le remède. Vos ministres
ne pensent pas à la guérison du malade. Ils veulent conserver
la maladie. Cela est digne de vieillards qui n’ont que quelques
<a id='corr223.27'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='annés'>années</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_223.27'><ins class='correction' title='annés'>années</ins></a></span> devant eux, mais je doute que les grands ministres du
commencement de ce siècle eussent pensé et agi de la sorte.</p>

<p class='c018'>Je viens d’un pays où l’on est très dévot et où la catastrophe
de Lamoricière a fait une grande sensation. J’ai vu des gens
fort piteux et fort découragés, mais nullement dangereux. Je
vois que Garibaldi se soumet et va reprendre sa charrue. Il
fait bien. Son affaire est de se battre, et il n’entend rien à
organiser. Il parait que le gâchis est grand en Sicile et à
Naples, et qu’il est parvenu à faire regretter le gouvernement
déchu. Cependant il parait que tous les gens sensés sont
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>unanimes pour croire que l’annexion est le seul moyen de rétablir
un peu d’ordre pour le moment. Je trouve qu’il y a de
l’habileté dans les ménagements de M. de Cavour pour Garibaldi,
mais j’aurais voulu le voir un peu plus énergique au
sujet de Mazzini. Je crains que les reproches de Lord Palmerston,
qui, entre nous, me semblent dénoter peu de bonne
foi, ne produisent pas un très bon effet sur l’Empereur. M.
Fould, que je n’ai pas rencontré ce matin, en sera, je pense,
très irrité. Je lui ai laissé un mot en le priant de ne faire
aucun usage de cette lettre avant d’en avoir causé avec moi.
Vous pouvez, quand vous en trouverez l’occasion, assurer
hautement que s’il y a eu en Irlande quelques menées contraires
au Gouvernement Anglais, elles sont l’&oelig;uvre de nos
Catholiques et que le Gouvernement de l’Empereur n’y est pour
rien absolument.</p>

<p class='c018'>We next offer Mr. Gladstone’s opinion of England’s
relations with France, and would draw attention to
the sense of security pervading his expressions in a
letter to Panizzi. How these sentiments were modified
at a later date will be shown further on:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“My dear Panizzi,</p>

<p class='c019'>I return all; but I have not, I think, completely
deciphered M. Mérimée’s important letter. If there is a flavour
of bitterness in it, I cannot deny that it may be in some
degree due to us. Instead of saying anything akin to what
is complained of, I will merely point to topics of consolation,
such as follow. In my opinion, under the present Ministry,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>no coalition will be formed against France. The English
nation is really Italian in feeling; and in proportion as
France is the same will there be a broader and firmer ground
for concord and co-operation. The foolish alarms which have
been unhappily prevalent in this country are abating by
degrees. They implied a most extravagant compliment to
France, and a compliment that I for one grudged her not a
little. Lastly, the Commercial Treaty, if the work be completed
by the French Government in the spirit of courage,
sagacity, and good faith with which it has been begun, will,
by processes all the more safe because they are quiet and
gradual, lay the most solid foundations of active goodwill
between the two countries. How much I desire that goodwill
I can hardly tell you. France and England are the two
really great Powers of Europe; and two such forces, if they
move in severance from one another, cannot but disturb the
political system. The case of Savoy and Nice was, as I think,
an unhappy one; but if on the one side it may be said that it
was exceptional, and if on the other calm reflection must admit
that it has been made too much of, then every day that passes
over our heads will have its healing power. On the whole,
unless we have new faults and follies, we ought to do well in
this all important matter.</p>

<p class='c018'>Panizzi’s letter of September 30, above-quoted, was
forwarded by Mérimée to M. Achille Fould, and in due
course he replied, commenting on it. As the correspondence
would be incomplete without this, it is
inserted, but the contents scarcely call for any special
remarks on our part.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Mon cher collègue,</p>

<p class='c019'>En vérité notre ami Panizzi, ou ses honorable
interlocuteurs ont une singulière idée du caractère de l’Empereur.
S’il fallait attacher de l’importance aux propos que
vous transmet M. Panizzi, Machiavel ne serait qu’un enfant
naïf auprès de Napoleon III. Pendant que nous faisons des
efforts pour calmer l’irritation de l’Espagne, et arrêter son zèle
pour la cause de Rome, c’est l’Empereur qu’on accuse d’avoir
sous mains provoqué le rappel de la Légation Espagnole de
Turin, et je le sais de la meilleure source, rien n’est plus faux
que cette dernière supposition. Ce qui est vrai, c’est que nous
avons essayé d’agir dans un sens tout à fait opposé à celui
allégué. Voilà pour l’affaire d’Espagne.</p>

<p class='c018'>Quant à l’envoi de notre flotte à Gaeta je conviens qu’il y a
une sorte de contradiction dans notre conduite; mais elle est
bien plus apparente que réelle. Les explications diplomatiques
ont <a id='corr226.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='déjâ'>déjà</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_226.19'><ins class='correction' title='déjâ'>déjà</ins></a></span> été données sur ce point. L’envoi de la flotte a été
purement une affaire de sentiment et d’humanité. Si cette
mesure manque de logique elle ne peut pas être taxée de parjure.
La meilleure preuve de notre sincérité, c’est que nous
avons immédiatement désillusionné le Roi de Naples, à qui la
présence de nos vaisseaux avait donné des espérances mal fondées,
en lui refusant de faire avancer un corps de troupes à
Terracina, comme il nous le demandait. Je crois savoir que
Ferdinand (François) II., s’apprête à profiter de notre flotte
pour quitter Gaeta. On ne pourrait vraiment pas reprocher à
l’Empereur de s’être laissé toucher par le malheur de ce jeune
souverain et la situation de la famille dont il est entouré.</p>

<p class='c018'>Quant à la question d’alliance entre la France et l’Angleterre
pour régler le sort de l’Italie je ne sais que vous dire.

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>Now follows the exposition of Mr. Gladstone’s
modified views, set forth in two letters. From these
we gather that, on further observation, he had come
to regard the conduct of the Emperor of the French,
both in Italy and elsewhere, as somewhat more than
equivocal, and as calculated to engender strife, and
threaten the existing peaceful relations of the two
countries:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“Nov. 26, 1860.</div>

<p class='c018'>“My dear Panizzi,</p>

<p class='c019'>You know, and therefore I need not describe,
the spirit in which I received your recent communications
respecting certain conversations which you held in Paris, and
in which I have looked upon the acts of your interlocutor.
But since I saw you his conduct has really become so equivocal
that I do not see how it is possible for one who pursues it to
expect that he should retain confidence, much less that he
should remove mistrust.</p>

<p class='c018'>The seizure of Terracina is defended, if at all, by a plea
which seems little short of ridiculous—I mean strategic
necessity for the defence of Rome.</p>

<p class='c018'>But there is a construction for the act alike obvious and
rational—namely this, that disturbance is to be prolonged in
Southern Italy, under the notion that the establishment there
of a nation and a kingdom is an evil, and that every chance is
to be kept open of averting it.</p>

<p class='c018'>It seems intended to facilitate the escape of the soldiers of
King Francis into the mountain districts of the Regno, and to
make those districts the focus of resistance to Victor Emmanuel.</p>

<p class='c018'>This construction is supported by the incomprehensible conduct
of France with respect to Gaeta.</p>

<p class='c018'>If Victor Emmanuel could be conceived anxious to get hold
of Francis and his family, then we could also conceive the
duty or the policy of baffling him; but it is impossible that
the French Government can entertain such an idea.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>To keep open Gaeta on the side of the sea is to prolong
suffering and bloodshed for the present—fear and insecurity for
the future. Such a policy, if it be a policy, appears inhuman.
I admit that, notwithstanding the unhappy affair of Savoy,
and especially of Nice, the great acts done by France for
Italy last year have rendered to that country an inestimable
service. I do not enter into any comparative question as
between the path pursued by France and that taken by England.
I assume no right to be her judge. I merely write in
the interest of peace, and of a fervent desire that there should
be constant and cordial goodwill between France and England.
Whatever susceptibility my countrymen may have shown, a
consistent course on the part of the French Emperor with
regard to Italy would have been acknowledged by them.
They were utterly thrown abroad by the terms of Villafranca;
but they, perhaps, did not then make sufficient allowance for
difficulties, and they were pleased to see that Zurich was an
amendment upon the prior proceeding. But what is it possible
to say or think or urge when the Sardinian force is only
permitted to conduct one-half a siege, and when (as I am
told) the French have either secured the passage, or themselves
actually carried provisions into Gaeta?</p>

<p class='c018'>Before these unhappy proceedings, the English mind was
getting rapidly clear of its prepossessions. The publication
of the Treaty, in which the Emperor has behaved so admirably,
will do an infinity of good—or will, at any rate, lay the
ground for it—and this will grow as the terms of it are better
understood. Why is an opportunity to be made for the light-minded
and the evil-minded to point to other ambiguities or
conduct on questions in which it is of such vast importance
that France and England should have a common feeling?</p>

<p class='c018'>“My dear Panizzi,</p>

<p class='c019'>I return the letter you sent me. It was, I
think, quite capable of a good construction on Nov. 4, when
it was written; and the writer tells us he had then learned
that Ferdinand, evidently meaning Francis, was about to use
the French Fleet as a means of escape. By this time he must
have pretty well unlearned that piece of knowledge, and the
character of the act, I think, stands out such as I described it
yesterday. I impute no Machiavelism, or ism of any other
kind. What I have been saying to every one all this year has
been, <em>Give the Emperor’s acts a fair construction</em>; but a fair
construction of <em>these</em> acts unhappily lends to them a rather foul
aspect. I entirely withhold even now my belief from any
such notions as those which you describe in your last page,
and I do not take these false strokes of policy as indications of
a plot extending far beyond them. They may be due to uncertainty,
and to apprehensions of the future Italy; such as
are, however, quite unworthy of a country so able and so
certain to hold its own as France. But they are alike deductions
from the glory it has won, evils in themselves, menaces
to the general peace, and sources of mistrust <em>here</em>, such that as
far as they go make it impossible to deny that the feeling is
legitimate.</p>

<p class='c018'>As to my interest in Italy, I wish it could be one-tenth part
as useful as it is true. She has been to me for the last eighteen
months a principal cause, not only of joy and satisfaction, but
even of the desire for political existence.</p>

<p class='c018'>The substance of these two letters was forthwith
communicated as follows by Panizzi to Mérimée:—</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span></div>
<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“B. M., 29th November, 1860.</div>

<p class='c018'>“... Shortly after my return I informed
Mr. Gladstone of my having had the honour of conversing
with His Majesty, and told Mr. Gladstone of
the great interest with which the Emperor spoke of
him. This gentleman was much pleased with what I
told him, but was of opinion that certain actions had
been unjustly judged, and felt confident of the loyalty
of the Emperor; and, notwithstanding the conduct of
General Goyon at Viterbo, and of Admiral Barbier de
Tinan at Gaeta, he still adheres to his former opinions.</p>

<p class='c018'>“But yesterday Mr. Gladstone sent me a long letter,
in which he tells me how he deplores the conduct of
the Imperial Government at Gaeta, at Viterbo, at
Terracina, and, in fact, everywhere; and which
almost confirms what he has constantly tried to make
people disbelieve. He is much mortified. I answered
him, but from a second letter received this
morning, I feel I cannot conceal the sudden change
in Mr. Gladstone’s convictions. And if so firm a
partisan of the Emperor has changed, think what the
effect must be on those who have always suspected
the Emperor.</p>

<p class='c018'>“As His Majesty placed so much confidence, and
justly so, in the sentiments of Mr. Gladstone, I have
thought it right to inform him (H.M.) of this change
and its cause, and this I do entirely at my own risk,
hoping that something will be done, in order to
restore to His Majesty the confidence of those who,
here, are his real friends. As for myself, I am at
your disposal.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“My dear and distinguished Friend,</p>

<p class='c019'>You are already aware that I wrote to let the
Emperor know of the bad impression which his conduct was
producing here, and that Mr. Gladstone, who had always
defended him, was beginning to feel it impossible to trust in
him, especially after what he did at Gaeta.</p>

<p class='c018'>The Emperor has read my letter, and has given me to
understand, in answer, that his feelings are the same as they
were two years ago: that he still wishes to promote the independence
of the Italian nation, and ever so many fine things
of that sort, which amount to nothing. But there is in the
answer a passage of considerable importance, which I copy:—'The
Emperor replied to me that all that has been done was
done in concert with the King’s Government, and that it
would be wrong to hold him alone responsible for what has
happened. The King is quite aware of the Emperor’s ideas
on all that has taken place; and he knows, moreover, what
the Emperor ardently desires above all.’ I know not what
to think of this. Neither the King nor his Government
can have approved either the conduct of Guyon or
that of Barbier de Tinan, of which I specially complained.
How is all this going on? I don’t know, and cannot
stomach it.</p>

<p class='c018'>My rejoinder was that if the matter stood as thus reported
to me, I could not but confess that the King’s Government
was involved in the responsibility, but that I was unable to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>comprehend why such a King should be patronized as he of
Gaeta, sprung of a generation of ruthless tyrants; that we
should never have expected to see the wings of the Imperial
eagle extended over the lawless people of Naples, red with
human blood, and that we were completely at sea. I said too,
that the most influential persons here believed the Emperor
was favourable to a certain measure of Italian independence,
but not to Italian unity; and to this is attributed the protection
accorded to the King of Gaeta; that it was held for
certain too that H.M. would go to war next spring, but not
for the unity of Italy.</p>

<p class='c018'>I ought perhaps to have said more, but did not wish to go
beyond certain limits. There are some here who think that
the Emperor has an understanding with you over there to go
to war next spring, but I do not know what good it would do
us to have Francis at Gaeta. In short we understand nothing
at all.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Yours, &amp;c., &amp;c.,</div>
      <div class='line in16'><span class='sc'>A. Panizzi</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>“P.S.—Please tell Hudson what I am writing. I have let
Palmerston and Gladstone read the answer which I got from
Paris: they have both formed the same opinion of it.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>What schemes and intentions the Emperor may
have secretly entertained at this period (if, indeed, such
a creature of circumstances can be supposed to have
been capable of possessing fixed intentions beyond the
exigencies of the hour) will probably remain hidden
from human ken until records now in obscure recesses
shall come out into the light of publicity. That ambitious
ideas floated through his brain, and that, if it had
been possible to carry out his projects, he would have
hesitated but little about the means of executing
them, there is little doubt; but that, for some reason,
he did not see the way to their fulfilment seems
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>equally certain. Happily—and probably owing to
the firm attitude of England—the cloud passed over,
and no rupture occurred between the two great
powers. In a little more than two years after the
date of the letter last quoted, Panizzi received from
the Emperor a second invitation to Biarritz. What
led to this invitation we find him thus explaining to
his friend Ellice:—</p>

“... It is perfectly true that Her Majesty,
on hearing from Mérimée himself that I was to pass
through Paris, did me the honour of inviting me to
dine at St. Cloud last Wednesday, which of course I
did. I am not, however, so conceited as to suppose
that Her Majesty, who knows me very little, asked
me in consequence of that slight knowledge of me;
no doubt she asked me out of kindness to Mérimée.
We had a most agreeable party on that day. The
Empress was kind, more than I can express, both at
dinner and after, when the ladies and gentlemen who
had dined, accompanied by several carriages (she
driving her mother) went to see a new contrivance
to run carriages on a railway (of which I understood
nothing). We returned to St. Cloud about 11 o’clock
by bye-lanes without any escort whatever, and in the
most private manner. The Emperor, who was to
arrive on that day, not having come, the Empress
most gracefully said that Mérimée and I must wait for
him, and dine again yesterday, which we did. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>was uncommonly gracious and friendly; owing to a
mistake, we arrived long before the dinner hour; we
walked in the garden, Her Majesty, and Mérimée, as
well as myself, till dinner time; then, after dinner,
he called me to a private room and we had a long
conversation, during which he encouraged me to
speak out, and I did so. The conclusion was an
invitation to Biarritz. I was most struck with the
Prince Imperial. He is a handsome, intelligent,
charming boy; he speaks English just as well as
you do....”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>This chapter may close with part of a letter from
Panizzi to Mr. Gladstone, wherein he appears to give the
result of his visit to Biarritz, and of his conversations
with the Emperor Napoleon. Much of the provocation
stated by the writer to have been given to His
Majesty it is difficult to deny; but those who have
studied the subject, or retain any memory of the circumstances
of the time, will agree that the conduct
of the Emperor himself was the chief source of all
those accusations, true or false, which were brought
against him.</p>

<p class='c018'>“... As to the conduct of Napoleon respecting
Italy, of course you know I am completely with you;
but I must say that some of our friends have acted
as if they wished to furnish him with a pretext for
behaving as he has hitherto done. He has been told
that no confidence can be placed in his word (if even
true he cannot like to be told), he has been <em>bullied</em>
and threatened, those who have treated him with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>insolence and have grossly insulted him, not only as
Emperor, but as if he were the vilest of mortals, have
been made most of by some public men in England
(I will tell you what I allude to when we meet), all
this has greatly, and not unnaturally, vexed him, and
indisposed him to listen to the advice of statesmen
whom he no longer considered as his friends. One
of the very few Frenchmen who looks upon the
English alliance as the best for France, as well as for
the good of Europe generally, and who has long been
doing his utmost to smooth difficulties and soften
asperities has often said to me:—<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘On se croit
réciproquement plus mauvais qu’on n’est en réalité,
il n’y a pas moyen de s’entendre.’</span> I have found by
experience the perfect truth of this.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>Here we abandon this subject: leaving at the same
time material for much thought as to the instability
of all human events, either private or public, and as to
the uncertainty of individual character. How inconspicuous
may be the turning-point upon which hangs
the good or evil of the future, and with what jealous care
the actions of the powerful and ambitious should be
watched; how a thought or a word may lead to the
misery and destruction of thousands; and how soon
all that was fair, prosperous, and peaceful may be
turned into hideous bloodshed, dissension, and misery!
Like the Cæsars of old, the Napoleonic dynasty
was ever craving for increased dominion; and although
we, who live in these later days, have seen
the last hopes of Imperial power in France seemingly
extinguished, as we look back to the time when such
haughty spirits had to be kept in check, we cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>but feel a certain amount of gratitude that
such contingencies are unlikely ever again to inspire
us with apprehension from so formidable a
quarter.</p>

After his return from Biarritz the
strain to which the constitution of
Panizzi had been subjected by his
laborious life gave him decided warning
of failing powers. Amongst
other disagreeable symptoms he suffered much from
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>insomnia</i></span>. On several occasions he informed the
author of these memoirs that he feared he should
be compelled to relinquish his position at the British
Museum; nevertheless he continued to carry on his
work with ardour. He rose every morning at 8
o’clock, and appeared at his post by 10. Struggling
against growing infirmities, and using every means to
restore his health and perform his duties, he applied
to the Trustees for leave of absence from the 15th of
Dec., 1862, to the 1st of May following. It need not
be said that his request was granted. As Principal
Librarian it was incumbent on him before leaving to
fix upon some competent officer to discharge his important
duties; and this substitute he very soon found
in the person of his longwhile colleague Mr. J.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>Winter Jones, at that time Keeper of the Printed
Book Department. This gentleman he nominated as
his deputy in accordance with the rules of the Institution
set forth in the 2nd Chap., §§ 2 and 3 of the
statutes. The document, which gave legal force to
this temporary transfer of office, was signed by the
Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Speaker of the
House of Commons, on the 9th of December, 1862.
Soon afterwards Panizzi received a kind and sympathizing
letter from Sir G. Cornewall Lewis, dated
December 16, 1862:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c018'>“Some of your friends are apprehensive that your
labours at the Museum have been detrimental to
your health, and are of opinion that you would
derive some benefit from a short interval of rest. I
was not aware, when I had the pleasure of seeing you
yesterday, that you had been unwell; but pray let me
know whether you are desirous of leaving London for
a time for the sake of your health. If you are, the
matter might doubtless be represented to the Trustees.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I have read your report upon the present state of
accommodation at the Museum.</p>

<p class='c018'>“After the recess, I intend to move for a Committee
on the National Gallery question, to which the papers
relating to the deficient space at the Museum may be
referred.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>On the 18th of December Panizzi, accompanied by
the author, who had been sent from school, started
for Naples. So far as Marseilles the journey was
satisfactorily accomplished, the travellers occupying a
special carriage, provided by order of the Emperor.
Panizzi had called on His Majesty on his way through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>Paris, and thus this accommodation had been afforded
him. Arriving at Marseilles, the travellers embarked
on board one of the <em>Messageries</em> steamers, trusting to
reach Naples by Christmas Day. A terrific storm, however,
which burst upon them shortly after starting,
delayed their progress; so severe was it that at one
moment they were in jeopardy of their lives. At last,
after a most tedious passage, Civita-Vecchia was
sighted. Here they landed, and, leaving it on the
following day, reached Naples on the 26th.</p>

<p class='c018'>As in 1852, Panizzi went to Lady Holland’s residence
at the Palazzo Roccella, whence he sent Mr.
Ellice (January 13, 1863) his first observations on the
changes which had taken place at Naples:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“... This country, after centuries of misgovernment,
will take many years before it derives
from the new state of things the advantages which we
all wish; there is, however, an undeniable improvement,
in spite of the priests, the brigands, and the
Emperor of the French, in everything. The dislike of
the Bourbons is general, and there is no Muratist
party; but the late Italian Ministry has done everything
in its power to create dissatisfaction by the
pedantry of its regulations, the total disregard of the
habits, feelings, and prejudices of this ignorant population,
and the incredible want of tact in its agents.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Just at the time of the arrival at Naples, an English
gentleman had been arrested there on the charge of
being the bearer of treasonable letters from Rome.
He happened to be a friend of Panizzi’s, and consequently
no little anxiety and apprehension arose in
the mind of the latter regarding his future destiny.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>On an early day in January therefore, Panizzi,
Lord Henry Lennox, and the writer set out to visit
the prisoner; the necessary permission to do so was
not, however, obtained without considerable difficulty.
By an extract from a letter on this case, written by
the first-named to a friend, it seems that since the
disappearance of the old <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>régime</i></span> some considerable
improvement in the treatment of political offenders
had been introduced:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“Jan. 13th.</div>

<p class='c018'>“I have just been to see Mr. X—--, and I must
say that a better prison I never saw. He has a magnificent
view, good food, books, and is allowed to see
friends. The Governor, who is a worthy man, retired
the moment we entered the room., There was
some difficulty in allowing young Fagan to enter the
prison, so we made use of him by telling him to take
note of all he saw. The sentence passed on our
friend is certainly severe, but he fully deserves it.
Still, I am doing my best to get him off as lightly as
is possible.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>Panizzi took a sensible view of the way of enjoying
and availing himself of the advantages of a vacation.
To his active mind, perfect quiescence was not for a
moment to be tolerated; and he resolved upon that
wholesome and necessary recreation and diversion,
which have so great a tendency to restore relaxed
vigour. Delightful were the excursions made in and
around Naples. One of these was to the celebrated
Benedictine Monastery of La Trinità della Cava,
founded in 1011 by Alferius Pappacarboni, its first
Abbot. Here the library, with its rare and priceless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>contents, was, as may be imagined, the chief point of
attraction. The visitors were to have been accompanied
by the then abbot, Pappalettere, who, as well as
Padre Tosti, of Monte Cassino, was a much esteemed
friend of both Mr. Gladstone and Panizzi. Unfortunately
Pappalettere had lately got himself into bad
odour with the Pope, having rashly expressed himself
respecting the Italian cause in terms too favourable to
suit the taste of his Holiness, and had, in consequence,
been summoned to Rome to give an account of his conduct.
Panizzi, consulted as to the course he would
recommend him to adopt, at once advised him to disregard
the invitation, and to remain quietly where he
was—sound advice, and, as the sequel shows, wise, had
it been acted on. There are individuals, however,
who, asking for advice, disregard it, and adopt the
contrary course; and in this instance one of this class
was Pappalettere. Obeying the Pope, he went to
Rome, and, as a reward for his obedience, underwent
what can be expressed by no other words than some
years of close confinement. On one expedition to La
Cava the travellers had a narrow escape from a sudden
termination to their earthly career. In proceeding
along a portion of the road, bordering on a deep precipice,
either from the overladen state of the carriage
or from the bad condition of the road, a wheel came
off. The promptitude and agility of the driver, saved
the party from inevitable destruction. Jumping down,
he at once pulled the horses from the threatening precipice;
but for his presence of mind the writer would
not have been here to record the mishap nor to present
the world with this memoir.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>Another visit in the neighbourhood was to Monte
Cassino, founded by St. Benedict A.D. 529, on the
site of a temple of Apollo. It is situated on a mountain
from which it derives its name, near the ruins of
the ancient Casinum, and approached by a well-paved
and winding road, the ascent of which occupies about
two hours. The Abbey in the eleventh and twelfth
centuries was the seat of science, particularly of medicine,
the celebrated School of Salerno having been
founded by the monks of Monte Cassino.</p>

<p class='c018'>Of this monastery, Dante thus speaks in Canto XXII.
of the “Paradiso,” line 37:—</p>

      <div class='line in22'>... In old days,</div>
      <div class='line'>That mountain, at whose side Cassino rests,</div>

      <div class='line in14'>—(<i>Cary’s Translation.</i>)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>At the time of this visit the founder’s tomb was in
course of restoration, and amongst those who contributed
to the good work was Mr. Gladstone, who requested
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>Panizzi to pay, in his name, to the restoration
fund the sum of 100 ducats, equivalent to about £16
of English money.</p>

<p class='c018'>One of the first acts of the newly-established Government
of Italy was the suppression of the religious
houses. Although it cannot be denied by the candid
student of history that, in mediæval times, Monastic
Societies were of the utmost benefit, and, indeed, in
many respects, actually necessary to civilization, and
to many other important ends; and although the debt
we owe them for the preservation of literature and
art, which, but for their fostering care, would have
eternally perished, can never be duly estimated; yet
it must be admitted by the most determined lover of
antiquity that, in the state of modern society, the
monastery is at the present day somewhat out of place.
The ends such Institutions formerly subserved, and
their power to subserve such ends, have alike become
extinct. In our times they appear to exist simply to
perpetuate the vicious and unreasonable principle
that a man may live in the world, yet not be of it,
that he may cast aside his duties as a citizen and
every feeling which binds him to his country, sacrificing
such sacred obligations to the devout (and selfish)
care of his own soul.</p>

<p class='c018'>At the time of which we write, Italy, above all
nations, abounded to superfluity in these establishments;
and suspicions, not ill-founded nor unreasonable,
were entertained of the loyalty of some of their
members, from the perpetual drain made by them on
the able-bodied population.</p>

<p class='c018'>It is, however, to be regretted that the officials to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>whom was entrusted the dissolution of the convents
of Italy did not set about their far from pleasant
duties in such a manner as to contrast more favourably
with the conduct of Henry VIII. under similar
circumstances, whereas they displayed an amount of
harshness and brutality—nay, cruelty—calculated to
throw discredit not only on themselves, but on the
country by which they were employed, and, what is
more serious still, on the character of Italians in
general.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c018'>Panizzi, ever alive to injustice and cruelty, and
jealous of the fair fame of his country, with an equal
abhorrence of the wrongs committed in the name of
freedom and of a liberal constitution, though weighed
with the tyrannies of King Bomba, was especially indignant
at the conduct of the Commission. On this
painful subject he gave free vent to his feelings in a
letter dated the 13th of January, 1863, and, as the
following lines will show, did not confine himself to
a simple expression of feeling:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c018'>“... What will you think of my having turned
protector of monks and nuns? Yet such is the fact.
I have been so disgusted with the harsh proceedings of
the President of the Commission appointed to take
possession of the property of religious corporations
that I could not help doing my best to get the fellow
removed from his office; and I am glad to say he has
been recalled to Turin by telegraph, and another
person appointed, of whom everybody speaks well.
The illegalities which are committed are innumerable....”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>Similar sentiments are expressed in another letter
to Mr. Gladstone, from which the following is an
extract:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“Naples, January 18, 1863.</div>

<p class='c018'>“... So soon as I arrived here I found that the
person who was at the head of the Commission for
the suppression of convents, monasteries, &amp;c., behaved
with unjustifiable harshness and rudeness: the dissatisfaction
and discontent his conduct caused cannot
be exaggerated. I backed the representations made
to the Ministers to put an end to this abuse of
authority, and the fellow was recalled by telegraph.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>These honourable protests against oppression, and
possibly others more openly made in language equally
forcible, caused an abundance of silly surmises and
talk of the conversion of Panizzi, and of his having
become an adherent of the Pope and of the Bourbons,
&amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c018'>Utterly unworthy as were these of being repeated,
we should leave the subject unmentioned, did it not
afford the opportunity of introducing a letter, dated
Turin, the 2nd of April, 1863, too important to
be omitted, from that distinguished diplomatist and
most amiable of men, Sir James Hudson:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c018'>“This is the first quiet moment I have had since I
received yours of the 25th.</p>

<p class='c018'>“How can you seriously pay attention to the chatterboxes
of Naples, who had written here that you
had gone over to the enemy? But, my dear friend,
you don’t suppose that in Upper Italy anybody would
believe such ridiculous gossip!</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>“I knew very well that you would have come here
at once had I asked you to do so. But the necessity,
the strait we were in, was not sufficiently great to
require that sacrifice. I will tell you what it is when
we meet.</p>

<p class='c018'>“And now about meeting. I still say, ‘Don’t put
yourself out,’ don’t come to Genoa merely to see Giacomino.
If you come to Genoa, you <em>must</em> come here.
It’s all very well to say, ‘I don’t want to see anybody
but you.’ Well, that’s like <em>you</em>; but it won’t do.
<em>You</em> cannot come so near Turin, and not come to
Turin. You occupy too large a space in the Italian
and European eye. Many people want to see you
especially Minghetti and Amari, and doubtless
Peruzzi.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The journey is nothing now over the Mont Cenis.
If you say positively you won’t, why I can’t help it;
but I repeat, don’t come to Genoa if you won’t come
to Turin. But if you do come to Genoa I will meet
you there. We shall meet in July at all events, for
I am quite serious in declaring my intention of residing
with you at the British Museum, and am very
grateful for the kind reception you have given to my
proposition.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I have read your letter <em>three times</em>, which is what
I never did for a Foreign Office instruction.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I have not a word of news to send you.</p>

<p class='c018'>“God bless you!</p>

<div class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Giacomino.</span>”</div>

</div>

<p class='c018'>On the 1st of May, 1863, Panizzi returned to his
duties at the Museum; and with melancholy reflections
we must here record that his life of action had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>practically reached its limits; not, however, that the
patriot’s zeal had in any way decayed, nor had
the politician’s interest in public affairs relaxed one
iota.</p>

<p class='c018'>To this point we have endeavoured briefly to follow
up the fortunes of Italy from the year 1820. How
much energy had been expended, how many lives of her
truest sons had been devoted to the achievement of
her liberty and union, and how far England had lent
her powerful aid towards the accomplishment of the
dearest wishes of patriotic Italians, it is beyond our
province to discuss, and we leave such questions to be
answered in the sterner pages of history.</p>

<p class='c018'>Though natural decay crept on Panizzi, and though
he felt his powers decreasing, he still continued his
activity of body and mind, not resigning himself, as
many men would have done, to indolence and absolute
rest, but still taking an interest in all that was
occurring around him, proffering aid and counsel
where it was required or willingly received, and
turning a stern countenance to everything approaching
injustice.</p>

<p class='c018'>Returning to his official duties in England, he
cheerfully resigned the beauties of his native Italy,
although to him they must have had an especial
charm, and doubtless he coincided with the patriotic
Neapolitan who exclaimed:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c012'>
    <div><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“Vedi Napoli e poi muori!”</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Yet not in this balmy air, nor within the influences of
that sea whose azure tint delights the eye did he
linger; duty called him thence, and at the post of
duty was Panizzi ever to be found.</p>

Correspondence; Death of Lord Palmerston; Superannuation;

During 1863 Panizzi repeated his
visit to Biarritz, and his Italian
friends urged him to see the Emperor
Napoleon, and to cultivate that potentate’s
friendship. With reference
to their arguments, he thus wrote to Mr Ellice: ‘I
am urged by Lacaita and Pasolini to go, who think I
may do some good, <em>which I do not hope in the least</em>.’
However, he went; but on the 15th of October, 1863,
he wrote to Mrs Haywood: ‘I have been abroad on a
visit to the Emperor and the Empress of the French,
with whom I spent four weeks. I might have
remained a little longer, but on receiving the
news of the death of Mr. Ellice, the greatest friend
I had lost since I lost one (Mr. Haywood) still more
dear to me, and to whom I owed more, I hasten
back to England.... My rheumatic
pains have become more violent, and curiously, or
rather unfortunately enough, my right wrist is more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>affected than my other joints, which renders my
writing always difficult and painful—at times impossible.
As you may conceive, as writing is what I
must do, this distresses me greatly. At night, too, I
suffer particularly, and am kept from sleeping, so
that in the daytime I cannot work as energetically as
I used to do, and as is required of one who fills my
place. I have often thought of resigning, but the
Trustees won’t hear of it, and flatter me by saying I
am absolutely necessary to the Museum, which I do
not think!’</p>

<p class='c018'>In fact Panizzi, with all his conscientious care of
himself, that he might still be fit for office, had never
succeeded in rooting out the seeds of that illness
from which he suffered so much in 1862. The same
exhausting sleeplessness at night wore him out, and
every symptom of disease seemed aggravated. How
acute were his sufferings the biographer well remembers,
and how, notwithstanding all, he never relaxed
the undeviating regularity of his attendance to official
duties.</p>

<div id='i249'  class='figleft id009'>
<img src='images/i_b_249.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c018'>His health was in the very
worst state when he received
from General Garibaldi a letter—very
brief—announcing an
intention of visiting London.
This news, which, under other
circumstances, might have been
a source of unalloyed gratification,
was not altogether welcome,
as it foreboded extra work
in Panizzi’s then condition, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>he well knew that on him would devolve much extra
care and supervision on behalf of the great patriot.
The entry of this illustrious hero into the metropolis,
the manner of his reception by the people, and the
acclamations with which so popular a stranger was
greeted, will not have faded from the recollection of
the majority of our readers. On the 15th of April,
1864, Garibaldi dined with Panizzi. The guests entertained
at the banquet were the Duke of Sutherland,
the Earl of Shaftesbury, Lord Wodehouse, Lord
Frederick Cavendish, Mr. Gladstone, Lord Granville,
Sir John, now Lord Acton, and the present writer.
At the end of dinner the General addressed his host,
expressing a strong and sincere desire to visit the
tomb of Ugo Foscolo, whose friendship for the subject
of the memoir has been mentioned in a former
chapter, and who was buried, it will be remembered,
at Chiswick.</p>

<p class='c018'>In accordance with this wish, at the early hour of
five o’clock on the morning of the 20th of April, Panizzi
and the present writer started from the Museum to
call on the General. They found him in bed, half
asleep; but, in compliance with their summons, he
arose, and in somewhat less than ten minutes came
downstairs, having thus promptly prepared himself,
as became a soldier.</p>

<p class='c018'>A brougham was ready to convey the three to their
destination at Chiswick; and it was on this occasion
that, for the first time, was suggested the advisability
of Garibaldi’s departure from London. Arrived at
Foscolo’s tomb, the General requested his friend to
address the crowd which their appearance had collected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>from all sides; the latter did not, however,
hesitate to declare frankly that such a course would
be contrary to the customs of this country. Not far
from these two distinguished personages stood, towering
above those surrounding him, a brewer’s man, of
gigantic proportions, who delivered himself in the
following words:—<em>Gentlemen, the man who is buried
there has done with the pen what Garibaldi has accomplished
with the sword!</em> Nothing in the way of
a speech could have been more appropriate, and so
thought all present.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>Panizzi had written to Massimo d’Azeglio on the
subject of Garibaldi’s visit to London and his reception
there. Azeglio’s most interesting reply will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>found at page 478 of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Lettere ad Antonio Panizzi</cite></span>,
&amp;c., <i>Firenze</i>, 1880, and will repay perusal. It is
dated the 25th of July, 1864, and occupies six pages,
but space will only allow us to give some extracts in
a free translation:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“I have always admired Garibaldi. When he was
beaten at Cesenatico I treated for peace with Austria,
and endeavoured to save him. Then I got him a
pension which he accepted for his mother and refused
for himself. I think with you that he is one of the
choicest natures created by the Almighty—a lover of
his country, enterprising, substantially humane and
generous, averse to cupidity, and he has rendered
eminent services ... but, after all, let me add that
no deserts, no extent of service, entitle a citizen to set
himself above the laws of his country and to violate
them. No one is allowed to create <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>imperium in
imperio</i></span>, to treat with his sovereign as an equal, to
outrage and ignore the constituted authorities, or to
assume the permanent decision of peace and war....
Garibaldi, by instinct shy and mild, has been thrust
forward by scamps for their own purposes, and they
have intoxicated him with flattery that would have
turned the brain of the hardest head, much more his....</p>

<p class='c018'>“You say that we are behindhand in respect for
the laws, and that we ought to follow the example of
the English. Let us see:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“After Aspromonte I was a member of the Council
of Ministers which was to decide the fate of Garibaldi.
I said: <em>Bring him to trial like any other citizen, and
after sentence let him he immediately pardoned by the
King</em>.... But it was thought better to grant him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>amnesty, which he refused, saying that he had only
done his duty.... Many of the Council were of my
opinion, and so were most of the people in the
country.... Before Aspromonte Garibaldi was
elected by acclamation in thirty districts; after Aspromonte
by <em>ballot</em> in two. The Italians said, we don’t
want prophets above the laws; one said even, we don’t
want him to come as a second Redeemer.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Do you think we are so very much behindhand?</p>

<p class='c018'>“Let us now turn to the English people. Garibaldi
went to them with the harbinger of a fantastic legend
such as no one ever had before. I should have
thought it natural for him to be received, applauded,
exalted, <em>clubbefied</em>, and <em>dinnered</em> by the whole population,
including the Italians in London. But that a
man who boasted of superiority to the laws, a man
still reeking with the blood of Italian soldiers whom
he had slain, should be officially received by the State,
by Parliament, by the Ministers, by the heir of the
English throne, with honours never accorded to any
sovereign ... and this while he who was receiving
them was the declared friend of Mazzini, who, could
he have got the chance, would have had all such personages
hanged, that this should have happened
amongst a people that thinks it has a mission to
preserve intact the idea of truth, of justice, and of
honour, must be bitterly deplored by every one of
sound common sense, and I cannot persuade myself
that you think differently.”</p>

<p class='c018'>To this we will append a translation of another
letter from the same writer, which will speak for
itself.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“Cannero, May 26, 1865.</div>

<p class='c018'>“Dear Panizzi,</p>

<p class='c019'>You will understand that I adopt Galileo’s experimental
method, not the doctrine of one of the Aristotelians.</p>

<p class='c018'>I had heard a worthy person speak of Spiritualism, and I
said to myself, <em>Let us see</em>, then I will believe.</p>

<p class='c018'>I have made a series of experiments <em>at home</em> with three or
four safe people, so as to be sure there should be no charlatanism.
Here is the result, which for me is definitively demonstrated.</p>

<p class='c018'>1st.—The experiments have produced phenomena absolutely
inexplicable by the ordinary laws which govern matter.</p>

<p class='c018'>2nd.—We put ourselves in communication with an intelligence,
to the exclusion of any explanation purely material.</p>

<p class='c018'>3rd.—It is impossible to establish either the personality or
the truthfulness of the said intelligence, hence the final result
is but of slight importance for any one who is not a
Materialist. I am not so and never have been; so the only
benefit that I derived from the experiments was to witness
phenomena which before I should have thought impossible.</p>

<p class='c018'>Those who are Materialists in good earnest ought necessarily
to accept Spiritualism.<a id='rH' /><a href='#fH' class='c015'><sup>[H]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>If you should have the same curiosity as I had, and would
like to make experiments, you ought to read the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Doctrine
Spirite</i></span>, a very common book. It is not right to judge any
doctrine until you are acquainted with it, and have tested it.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was bound to be acceptable to me, because it harmonises
with many of my old ideas on the origin of evil, so I found
myself at home. I do not say that it absolutely explains the
mystery, but it affords a glimpse of a solution much less illogical
than that of original sin, much more consistent with
divine perfection, and of far greater comfort in the uncertainties
to which we are condemned.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>Now you know as much about it as I do. If at any time
you should make up your mind to come to my place, we can
make experiments to your heart’s content.</p>

<p class='c018'>Take care of yourself and of your friendship for me, and
wish me well.</p>

<p class='c018'><a href='#rH'>H</a>. It has often been said that D’Azeglio was a believer in Spiritualism;

subject.</p>

<p class='c018'>In April, 1871, Panizzi received a semi-official
letter from General Menabrea, announcing the proposed
removal to Florence of Foscolo’s remains. We
are bound to say that the recipient did not much approve
of this step. He was of opinion that in Santa
Croce, where are the tombs of Dante, Michael Angelo,
Galileo, Macchiavelli, Alfieri, &amp;c., &amp;c., the exiled
patriot would be out of place. However, the following
inscription will tell the tale of the interment, removal,

The following note of invitation to Mr. Gladstone is
of an amusing character:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c018'>“My dear Sir,</p>

<p class='c019'>‘<em>Like a good fellow</em>,’ I will certainly dine with you on
Tuesday, the 25th instant.</p>

<p class='c018'>There is an Italian opera buffa, in which a gentleman who
wants to become a poet, and takes lessons as to the mechanism
of verse from a poet, wishing to ask his master to dine with
him, tries to convey his invitation in an hendecasyllable, and
begins, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Volete pranzare meco oggi?</i></span> (Will you dine with me
to-day?) but it would not do, so he changed, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Volete pranzare
meco domani?</i></span> (Will you dine with me to-morrow?) it would
not do either, and the poet suggested at once, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Volete pranzare
meco oggi e domani?</i></span> (Will you dine with me to-day and to-morrow)
a very good line, and so it was settled. Now I have
made a line for our dinner here, of which you must approve.
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Pranzate meco il ventitre e quattro</i></span> (Dine with me the 23rd

<p class='c018'>Such was the natural humour of the man that, as
in this instance, he seldom forebore from giving a
jocose turn to his subject when opportunity afforded.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>The first written intimation of Panizzi’s serious
wish to resign his high office is to be found in a letter

<div class='c011'>“British Museum.</div>

<p class='c018'>“My dear Sir,</p>

<p class='c019'>On seeing Lacaita yesterday I learnt from him,
as I expected, he had communicated to you my intention of
retiring from an office which I cannot any longer fill with
advantage to the public or satisfaction to myself. I am sorry
that you have learnt this intention of mine from a third party
and not from me, but if I have abstained from speaking of it
to you myself, it has been from motives of delicacy, and not to
seem to presume on the kindness you have uniformly shown
to me.</p>

<p class='c018'>My first impulse, indeed, was to speak to you, and to avow
how deeply I should feel to separate myself from an Institution
to which I owe so much, and in which I take, and shall ever
take, more interest than in anything else in the world; but
circumstances have arisen that, I fear, render it impossible it
can be otherwise.</p>

<p class='c018'>I do not mean to resign till after the discussion (whatever
be its fate) has taken place in the House of Commons; and I
then mean to offer to the Trustees my poor services for a
limited time and gratis, if they will condescend to accept
them, and should they consider them of any use till my successor
has got in harness, or any other arrangement is come to
which may be considered best for the Museum. I told this
to Lacaita yesterday, and you may have already heard it from
him.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c018'>This letter shows how deeply the thought of separation
from his beloved Institution, on which he had
centered all his energies and aspirations, affected him,
and how cogent must have been the reasons which
impelled him to meditate such a step.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>Mr. Gladstone’s reply was most complimentary, but
showed little inclination to fall in with the contemplated
scheme; it consisted of original Italian verses,
and admirable Italian too, a fine specimen of the
abilities of the great statesman in a language not his
own.</p>

<p class='c018'>On the 24th of June, 1865, however, Panizzi informed
the Committee of the Trustees that, in
justice to the Museum, as well as to himself, the state
of his health compelled him, much against his will,
to tender to Her Majesty the resignation of his appointment
as Principal Librarian. The Report in
which he made this communication ran as follows:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“Mr. Panizzi respectfully represents that he is
reluctantly compelled, humbly to beg of the Queen to
accept his resignation of the place of Principal Librarian,
to which Her Majesty was graciously pleased to
appoint him. Mr. Panizzi regrets being obliged, after
long hesitation, to take this step; but he finds that
neither in justice to this great Institution nor to himself,
he ought to continue to hold a place, the duties
of which, to be efficiently performed, require a vigour,
not only of mind but of body, which Mr. Panizzi is
conscious that he no longer possesses.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Mr. Panizzi hopes that the Trustees will add to
the many acts of kindness with which they have been
pleased to honour him, that of submitting to Her
Majesty’s Treasury the accompanying statement of Mr.
Panizzi’s services, and of recommending their Lordships
to award him such a superannuation allowance
as they may consider just, under the circumstances, in
conformity with the Superannuation Act, 1859, sections
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>2 and 9, with the Treasury letter of the 7th of
June, 1860, and with the Treasury Minute of the 24th
of August of the same year.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Should the Trustees do Mr. Panizzi the honour of
considering that, on his resignation being accepted by
Her Majesty, his knowledge of Museum affairs might
be of use to the Trustees for a limited period, to be
fixed by themselves, Mr. Panizzi will feel proud if his
humble gratuitous services be accepted, until his successor
can enter on his duties and become familiar
with them.</p>

<p class='c018'>“As a mark of respect to the Trustees, Mr. Panizzi
begs to submit to them his letter of resignation, previously
to transmitting it to the Secretary of State to
be laid before Her Majesty.”</p>

<p class='c018'>In consequence of this the subjoined resolutions
were passed:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“Saturday, June 24th, 1865.</div>

<p class='c026'>“Resolved:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“1.—The Trustees having heard that Mr. Panizzi
proposes to resign his office of Principal Librarian,
desire to record their deep sense of the ability, zeal,
and unwearied assiduity with which he has discharged
the many arduous and responsible duties which from
time to time have been committed to him.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“2.—That, in the opinion of the Trustees, the resignation
of Mr. Panizzi, at a period when great
changes are contemplated in the administration of the
British Museum, is to be peculiarly regretted.”<a id='rI' /><a href='#fI' class='c015'><sup>[I]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>“3.—The Trustees desire to state that the special
services of Mr. Panizzi, over and above his ordinary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>duties, have been of such a nature as to entitle him
to a special reward under the provisions of the 9th
Section of the Superannuation Act, 1859. They
would therefore urge that Mr. Panizzi possesses a
just claim to a retiring allowance equal to the full
amount of his salary and emoluments.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“4.—That the Chairman of this meeting is requested
to transmit the foregoing resolutions, together
with Mr. Panizzi’s report and its accompanying
enclosure, to the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty’s
Treasury.”</p>

</div>

<div class='footnote' id='fI'>
<p class='c018'><a href='#rI'>I</a>. This resolution was added on the special suggestion of Mr. Disraeli.</p>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The Trustees present on the occasion were:—The
Speaker, in the Chair, the Duke of Somerset, Lord
Eversley, Lord Taunton, The Right Hon. S. H. Walpole,
The Right Hon. B. Disraeli, The Right Hon. R
Lowe, Sir P. de M. Grey Egerton, Bart., Sir R. I.
Murchison, Dr. Milman, Major-General Sabine, C.
Towneley, Esq., and G. Grote, Esq.</p>

<p class='c018'>On the 7th of July following, Sir George Grey
wrote in answer:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“... It is with sincere regret that I have
learnt that you no longer feel yourself fully equal to
the duties of an office which you have so long filled
in a manner entirely satisfactory to the Trustees, and
eminently conducive to the interests of the Museum.”</p>

<p class='c018'>He then refers to the resolutions of the Trustees,
and continues:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“Under these circumstances it would afford H.M.’s
Government much satisfaction if, without risk of injury
to your health, you could continue your valuable
services to the Museum, at least until early in the
next year. I shall be obliged by your informing me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>whether you can concur in this arrangement, before
I lay the tender of your resignation before Her
Majesty.”</p>

<p class='c018'>The amount of the retiring allowance was £1,400
per annum, a goodly solace for old age and infirmities,
yet none too much for the unremitting zeal Panizzi
had evinced in the exercise of his important duties.</p>

<p class='c018'>On the 8th of July he reported to the Trustees his
willingness to place himself entirely in their hands,
and to continue, should they desire it, his services for
a while, an offer of which the Standing Committee
gladly availed themselves, expressing a hope that he
would continue his valuable exertions until the following
year.</p>

<p class='c018'>Let us, however, leave the Museum, for a few
minutes whilst we draw attention to that which, at
the time, assumed the proportions of a national
calamity.</p>

<p class='c018'>On the 18th of October, 1865, Lord Palmerston
departed this life. How severe a blow this was to
Panizzi may be judged from our frequent allusions to
the veneration in which he held the distinguished
statesman; and that Mr. Gladstone thoroughly
understood, and entered into his feelings, the letter
now quoted will show:—</p>

<p class='c018'>Another year was entered upon, and the Principal
Librarian yearned for rest. On the 5th of June,
1866, he addressed a letter to Sir George Grey,
earnestly requesting that he might be released from
his official duties, and on the 18th of the same month
received an answer from the Treasury informing him
that immediate steps would be taken to appoint a
successor. Eight days afterwards, on the 26th of
June, Mr. John Winter Jones was selected as the new
Principal Librarian. On finally relinquishing his post,
Panizzi addressed the following circular letter to the
heads of Departments:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“British Museum, July 16th, 1866.</div>

<p class='c018'>“I cannot leave the Museum, and close my official
connexion with those with whom I have had the
honour and pleasure of serving the Trustees for so
many years, without returning to all and each of them
individually my warmest thanks for the efficient help
which I have received from them in the discharge of
my duties. Although conscious of having at all times
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>acted to the best of my ability, and only for the
advantage of the Museum and of those connected with
it, I wish to add that, if I have ever given unnecessary
pain to any one, I regret it most sincerely, and trust
that credit will be given to me for having been uniformly
influenced solely by a sense of duty.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Allow me to request that you will bring this communication
to the individual knowledge of every
person in your Department. I shall always take the
warmest interest in their future happiness, and shall
never cease to feel the sincerest regard for them.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>Numerous and hearty were the responses, and it
must have been highly gratifying to their recipient
to know that his endeavours had gained the approval
of all, and that, now that the battle was over,
so far as he was concerned, he could rest satisfied
with his own share in the struggle which had ended
so triumphantly for himself. It will be unnecessary
to quote more than one of the replies, that from his
successor:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“British Museum, July 18th, 1866.</div>

<p class='c018'>“I have communicated to all persons in this
Department the kind and generous letter you have
been so good as to address to me on the subject
of your retirement from the post of Principal Librarian.
On this event there is but one feeling throughout
the Department—that of deep regret that we are
about to lose one who has the strongest claims upon
us all, not only for acts of personal kindness, but for
substantial benefits.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It is no secret throughout the House that whatever
improvement has taken place in the condition of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>those employed in it has originated with yourself and
been won by your exertions. They are indebted to
you for increased pay and extended vacations. They
are indebted to you for the abolition of the system of
payment by the day, which was injurious to the service
and painful to the feelings of the gentlemen employed.
Your exertions procured for the Library those increased
grants which have rendered possible its vast growth
and the high position it at present occupies. In short,
we feel, and are proud to feel, that all the important
improvements in the Institution had their origin in
this Department while you were its Chief Officer, and
that the very great development of the Museum
generally commenced at the period when you became
Principal Librarian.</p>

<p class='c018'>“For myself, I shall always feel most grateful for
the unvarying kindness with which you have treated
me during the long period of nearly thirty years that
I have acted more or less immediately under your
superintendence. Your advice, support, and encouragement
have never been wanting to me in all cases of
difficulty; and if the present state of the Library deserves
commendation, it is to you that the praise is
mainly due.</p>

<p class='c018'>“While speaking thus in my own name, I am in
fact speaking in the name of all, and only expressing
the sentiments which have been conveyed to me by
those in the Department. Although officially separated
from us, your name must always be inseparably
connected with this great Institution; and be assured,
my dear sir, that you carry with you into your retirement
not only the best wishes, but the warm and
affectionate feelings of us all.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>Shortly after he left his post a subscription was
set on foot throughout the Museum to present him
with a fitting testimonial; this ultimately took the
form of a portrait painted by Mr. George Frederick
Watts, R.A. It is now hung in, and forms one of the
chief ornaments of the Trustees’ Committee-Room.
As a likeness it is perfect, by far the most successful
example of the kind; as a picture it is one of the
finest works of the painter, the modern Tintoretto.
Produced in a low and yet powerful key of colour,
the whole work exhibits a potent combination of
ruddy-brown carnations, with black broken into deep
greys—tints which are admirably harmonized with
each other, and so happily toned as to produce just
and broad chiaro-oscuro. The figure is life-size,
three-quarters length, seated in three-quarters view
to our right, and easily, as well as sedately, posed in
a large chair; the head is slightly bent forward, and
the eyes, although directed <em>towards</em> the spectator, are
not directed <em>at</em> him; they have an expression of
habitual thoughtfulness which is very striking when
its influence is felt by the observer, and this is not
the less effective because it is undemonstrative.
Owing to the position of the eyes themselves, no reflections
of the light appear on their surfaces, which
by no means common circumstance adds to the
gravity, and even to the dignity of the picture, and is
perfectly faithful to nature. It increases the repose
of the work, and excludes that which is often a disturbing
element in designs of equal simplicity and
breadth of motive. The steadfast expression of the
features, and the restful attitudes of the body and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>hands, are valuable elements of this very important
and impressive master-piece of painting.</p>

<p class='c018'>We have given an exact and faithful account
of the causes which led to Panizzi’s resignation of the
office which he had held with honour for so many
years, of the manner in which it was carried out, and
of the testimonials which it evoked. We have now
merely to mention that in the House of Lords a scene
was enacted similar to that which took place in the
House of Commons on the 21st of April, 1856.
Whoever is anxious and willing to enter more fully
into that controversy, unpleasant as it was, need only
examine Hansard’s Parliamentary Debates, House of
Lords, Monday, February the 12th, 1866.</p>

<p class='c018'>Let us give Panizzi’s own words to prove whether
or not he was pleased and satisfied with the treatment
he received at the hands of the Trustees. He thus
wrote to Mrs. Haywood, on the 15th of July, 1866:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“The Trustees have behaved most handsomely, and
so has the Government, both in words and deeds.
First of all ample justice, and perhaps some may say
more than justice, was rendered to my long and many
services. I shall certainly remain in London, the
pension I am to get being ample for my wants; and
now, my dear Mrs. Haywood, let me add a few words
from my heart. The first feeling, when my future
was settled, was one of deep grief, that the friend who
would have so heartily rejoiced at the close of my
honourable career, who cheered me when lonely and
unknown, who thought of my welfare as much as he
did of his own, that he was no longer here. This
feeling overwhelmed me for a moment, and even now
I can hardly master it.”</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>It was a common remark of Panizzi’s that during
his long official career he had never, with very few
exceptions, (and even then he felt he had acted for the
best) shown favour to any one employed in the British
Museum who had not afterwards become an honour
to the Institution, and of this we have ample documentary
evidence, dating so far back as the year
1837.</p>

<p class='c018'>In the month of June, 1855, requiring the services
of a Hebrew scholar, he applied to the firm of Asher,
of Berlin, to recommend such a gentleman. Accordingly
<em>a certain young man of 23, and a Jew, endowed
with natural ability, who understood Latin, Greek, and
French, of strict moral integrity, and of faultless
character, and thoroughly respectable</em> was introduced
to the Keeper of the Printed Books; this was Emanuel
Deutsch, afterwards well-known as the writer of several
letters to <cite>The Times</cite> respecting the discovery and
reading of the Moabite Stone, and the article in the
<cite>Quarterly Review</cite> on the Talmud. This <em>Assistant</em>
was one whose talents his superior officer did not fail
to recognise. Unfortunately death claimed him at an
early age on the 14th of May, 1873.</p>

<p class='c018'>It is a somewhat delicate subject to touch upon,
but, as we are discussing these matters, we feel bound
to mention by name others who were, in a manner of
speaking, Panizzi’s children; and let us hope we are
not exaggerating or exceeding our proper limits by
remarking that they looked up to him as their protector
and adviser. For example, Mr. E. Maunde
Thompson, the present Keeper of MSS., was ever held
by him in high estimation, and also, in an equal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>degree, were Mr. John T. Taylor, Mr. John Cleave,
and Mr. Richard Garnett.</p>

<p class='c018'>The first of these became his intimate friend, and it
was also through his intervention that Mr. Taylor gave
such valuable literary aid to the late Princess Mary
Liechtenstein, in the compilation of the interesting
volumes entitled “Holland House.” Mr. Cleave,
then, as now, the Accountant of the Museum, had, as
we know, many lengthy discussions with Panizzi on
financial matters, and, indeed, the opinions of the
latter on these points were always regarded as decisive.
Greatly esteemed also was Mr. Garnett, whose appointment
as Superintendent of the Reading-Room
rejoiced the ex-Librarian extremely. Nor, although
he has left the Museum, should the name of Mr. W.
R. S. Ralston remain unmentioned.</p>

<p class='c018'>Many more names might be enumerated; one,
however, we will not omit—that of the clever mechanician
and metal-worker, Mr. Sparrow, who, by his
ingenuity, contrived or carried out many appliances
for the comfort of the aged Librarian. All were
labouring in unison as Panizzi’s barque was nearing
the harbour, after its eventful voyage; and truly reciprocal
were the feelings of friendship and respect
which had grown up between Panizzi and his fellow-workers—friendship
in full stream, flowing from the
purest sources.</p>

<p class='c018'>In this manner, applauded on all sides, beloved
and respected, did the Principal Librarian retire from
the position he had gained step by step by hard and
uninterrupted labour. Still the memory of the past
clung to him—still he would have devoted, had it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>been possible, his waning physical and mental strength
to the internal and external workings of that Institution
upon which he had so persistently set his heart.
His own words bear witness to the affection he
retained for the vicinity of his past efforts:—“I have
got,” wrote he, “a house. It is in a very unfashionable
quarter, though very respectable, near here, being
31, Bloomsbury Square.” So it was that he still
desired to linger with his memories and experiences
within sight of the building which had cost him so
much in brain and body, and those who read these
pages may easily conceive how far his thoughts were
interwoven with his expressions.</p>

<p class='c018'>We have endeavoured faithfully to detail the circumstances
of this eventful life, until the time arrived
when, succumbing to the stern dictates of nature,
Panizzi was compelled to retire behind those scenes
which his presence had so long graced.</p>

<p class='c018'>When the actor or the author departs from the
boards where his production or his acting has
delighted audiences, how acute is the grief of parting
with his admirers! Who does not remember the
almost ominous words of the late Charles Dickens,
when, at the last of his readings, he made use of the
remarkable expression, <em>From these garish lights I
vanish now for evermore, with a heartfelt, grateful,
respectful, and affectionate farewell</em>? These words—though,
of course, not exactly applicable to the present
case—may be strained so far as to indicate the deep
feeling with which a different, but not less successful,
contributor to public requirements was
severing himself from labours which had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>to him pre-eminently a “labour of love,” and
may justly be cited as implying the same affectionate
remembrance of his fellow-workers and those
who appreciated his undoubtedly great abilities.
In addition to a faithful recital of facts and an unprejudiced
view of the career of the chosen subject of any
memoir, a biographer owes somewhat more to his
readers. No life is worth recounting unless it affords
an example worth following, or unless it is acknowledged
at the first to have been set forth for some
other specific purpose, either as mere matter for
history, or as the life of one whose errors were so
great that it is thought advisable to reproduce them
as a warning to future would-be evil-doers.</p>

<p class='c018'>Nothing appertains to the present biography but an
intent to put before the world a man who, under the
most adverse circumstances and with the most beneficial
intentions, by sheer perseverance and by unflinching
energy, attained the object of his heart’s desire—a
desire that has redounded to his lasting praise.</p>

<p class='c018'>No words of our own shall be used. Let those of
Dean Milman be quoted as our justification for what
has been already said of the subject of our memoir.
On the 5th of February, 1866, writing from the
“Deanery of St. Paul’s,” he used these words:—“As
to his (Panizzi’s) public services, his long and most
careful connection with the British Museum cannot
be more fully or justly appreciated than by yourself”
(this letter was addressed to Sir R. I. Murchison), “and
I am sure that we should entirely agree on this subject.
Above all, the great national gift of the Reading-Room,
the envy and admiration of Europe, is, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>you well know, almost his entire creation, from the
original design to the most minute detail—from the
dome to the inkstands and bookshelves.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Those who knew Dean Milman will acknowledge
the worth of a testimonial thus given by such a man
to the value of Panizzi’s labours.</p>

<p class='c018'>Yet it is not here that we must stop short; an unbiassed
account has been rendered of his difficulties
at the outset of his career, never resting he persevered
in his onward journey where ordinary men
would have resigned the effort. His own national
misfortunes were enough to occupy his time and
thoughts; yet he found opportunities to attend to all
business that pressed upon his attention.</p>

<p class='c018'>These are the facts and uncontrovertible facts; and
the details upon which we have fully entered must
excite admiration for the man who could thus concentrate
his mind upon duties of the most onerous
description, and yet, when occasion required, be found
able and willing to befriend a cause which was
unquestionably as dear to his heart as any other—viz.,
the liberty, freedom, and happiness of his own
beloved Italy.</p>

<p class='c018'>No undue exaltation of Panizzi is intended on the
part of the biographer; wherever such may seem to
be attributed, it is from no personal panegyric of his
own.</p>

<p class='c018'>Numerous letters might be adduced corroborative
of the estimation in which the deceased was held—letters
whose signature place their contents beyond
suspicion; but they are withheld lest a charge of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>adulation should be laid at the author’s door, that
charge he has studiously endeavoured to avoid.</p>

<p class='c018'>At this important point in the narrative it has been
thought nothing but reasonable to pause, before
entering upon topics connected with the last years of
this eminent man.</p>

It would appear to be taking a liberty
with the reader—or, indeed, what is
far worse, to savour somewhat of
bookmaking—to engraft a biography
on a biography. We have already
promised to give some account of the relations
between Panizzi and Prosper
Mérimée, the well-known
writer and French statesman,
which account would be incomplete
were we to omit
some special mention of
Mérimée himself. It may
be asserted, moreover, that
Mérimée deserves, on his
own intrinsic merit, a place
in the memoir of Panizzi.
Happily it has been our
pleasing task of late to edit the whole of the letters
which passed between them during their long friendship,
and as nothing affords a better insight into the true
character of a man than his familiar epistles to his friends,
we shall make so bold as to use these letters as freely as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>may appear desirable in this short notice of the writer
of them. It is much to be regretted that Panizzi’s
letters to Mérimée have all been destroyed, with the
exception of the very few already quoted, copies of
which have been found amongst his papers. In the
time of the unhappy Commune, on the 23rd of May,
1871, amongst other and more important buildings,
Mérimée’s house was burnt down, and with it much
which would have been most valuable for our present
purpose. <em>What has distressed me most</em>, wrote a friend
to Panizzi on this calamity, <em>was to see the place where
poor Mérimée’s house had been! It is a total wreck!
All his furniture, his fine library, his manuscripts, his
letters, and the thousand souvenirs of a long and intellectual
lifetime all reduced to ashes.</em> In conversation
one day, Mons. Du Sommerard, of the Hotel Cluny,
whose name is frequently mentioned in Mérimée’s
letters, informed the present writer how he went to
the spot shortly after the fire, in the hope of saving a
few little things as souvenirs. But, alas! nothing
was left as a relic of Prosper Mérimée except an old
pipe.</p>

<p class='c018'>Happy indeed had he only succeeded in rescuing a
picture of Mérimée at five years old, painted by his
mother, and another by Alexander Colin, painted
about 1865.</p>

<p class='c018'>The biographer knew the house well, Number 52,
Rue de Lille (Paris), and remembers the room hung
round with pictures of the Spanish School and English
line-engravings. In September, 1869, he stayed with
Mérimée. May his vanity in inserting the following
record of that visit be pardoned by the reader!</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span></div>
<div class='quote0' style='font-size:95%' lang='fr' xml:lang='fr'>

<div class='c011'>“Paris, 15th September, 1869.</div>

<p class='c018'>“Mon cher Sir Anthony, <i>alias</i> Pan,</p>

<p class='c019'>“J’ai eu la visite de Fagan, qui a diné
avec moi Dimanche. Il m’a paru grandi et développé
de toutes les manières, toujours très bon garçon, conservant
malgré toutes les nationalités par où il a passé
l’air de <em>l’English boy</em>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>At what time and in what manner the acquaintance
between Panizzi and Mérimée began, we are unable
to determine. It would be passing strange, considering
the position of the two men and their frequent opportunities
of meeting, the similarity of their tastes and
opinions, and the numerous attractions which the
character of each must have had for the other, if
such acquaintance had never been formed, and
stranger still if it had failed to ripen into that intimate
and lasting friendship which afterwards subsisted
between them. Panizzi’s affection for his friend was
intense, and he used often to say (though we do not
allege this as any proof of the intensity of his friendship)
that he was the best Frenchman for whom he
had ever formed a liking. Mérimée, who was a
master of the English language, an accomplishment
which in his country ought to be less remarkable than
it is, was in the habit of spending a month or so
yearly in London. On these visits he always stayed
at Panizzi’s house. As regards his external characteristics,
he was tall of stature, upright in figure, and
his eyes shone with remarkable brilliancy; in manner
the most pleasing of men. One of his minor peculiarities
was an extreme nicety in the matter of dress, which,
though not an unfailing sign of genius and culture, may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>be put down to the credit of his good taste. And,
indeed, what more can be said in laudation of a
finished gentleman’s taste than that he had all his
clothes made in London, and not only in London, but
at Poole’s, of which great artist Mérimée was the
constant patron. This fastidiousness of his was the
cause of much facetiousness on the part of Panizzi,
to which, however, the other seems to have been not
altogether without means and opportunity of retort,
that is to say, if we rightly construe the following
passage in one of his letters containing a reflection
on an article of Panizzi’s ordinary costume, Mérimée
in asking some information as to a picture of Lord
Spencer’s, says:—</p>

<div class='quote0' style='font-size:95%' lang='fr' xml:lang='fr'>

<div class='c011'>“Cannes, 5, Décembre 1857.</div>

</div>

<p class='c018'>But in this friendly contest, if contest it may be
called, Mérimée had to deal with a less exquisitely
polished wit than his own, a wit which occasionally
when Panizzi was, or pretended to be, more than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>ordinarily annoyed by his friend’s extreme attention to
his attire, was developed in practical joking. One of
Panizzi’s especial dislikes, and for this he had sound
patriotic grounds of justification, was a peculiar cap,
much of the kind worn by officers of the Austrian
army, which Mérimée persisted in wearing both in
the house and in the garden, known as the <em>Principal
Librarian’s.</em> This was so peculiarly an object of annoyance
to the <em>Principal Librarian</em> that he once went
so far as to purloin the cap and lock it up, adding to
the peculation the sin of denying to its owner that he
knew anything whatever about it. Nor, though the
treachery was discovered, is it on record that the rightful
owner ever recovered possession of his property.
He had his revenge, however. That the ghost of the
victim should haunt the criminal, Mérimée made a
drawing of the cap, which he placed every morning at
breakfast, and every evening at dinner, in Panizzi’s
napkin. The kind of footing on which Mérimée was
at the British Museum may be gathered from the
following self-invitation to Panizzi’s:—</p>

<div class='quote0' style='font-size:95%' lang='fr' xml:lang='fr'>

<div class='c011'>“Paris, 14 Avril, 1858.</div>

<p class='c018'>“Vous recevrez de toute façon un mot de moi, qui
vous marquera précisément le jour de mon entrée dans
la ville de Londres. D’autre part, il se trouve que ma
cousine est un peu malade, en sorte que son mari reste
à Paris.</p>

<p class='c018'>J’irai donc, si vous voulez le permettre, droit au
British Museum à mon arrivée.—Cependant il faut
que nous fassions nos conditions.—La première, c’est
que vous ne vous dérangerez absolument en rien pour

<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>comme vous en avez l’habitude, sans vous inquiéter en
rien de ce que deviendra votre serviteur, qui est assez
pratique de Londres pour n’y pas mourir de faim ni
même d’ennui.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>At the Museum Mérimée was well known and a
great favourite with the whole staff. In this he took
just pride:—</p>

<div class='quote0' style='font-size:95%' lang='fr' xml:lang='fr'>

<div class='c011'>“Londres, Mardi, 7 Août, 1860.</div>

<p class='c018'>“Je reviens du British Museum qui m’a paru tout
sombre depuis votre absence. M. Bond m’a montré
un tres beau manuscript qu’on vient d’acheter pour
soixante livres sterling. Les <em>messengers</em> et les <em>attendants</em>
m’ont reconnu et ont été aussi aimables pour
moi qu’à l’ordinaire.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>Prosper Mérimée was born at Paris on the 28th of
September, 1803. His father, Jean François Léonore,
was a painter of some eminence. Prosper was educated
at the Collège Charlemagne, whence he passed
the course of <em>Ecole de Droit</em>, and in after years as is
well-known took an honourable position in political
life. It is not, however, our office here to enter on a
history of Mérimée’s career, which, as well as his
published works, has been too long before the world
to demand particular notice at our hands. Seeing
that we have been simply the mechanical means of introducing
to the public his letters to Panizzi, we
hold it to be no transgression of the limits of modesty
most heartily to commend these as among the best
specimens of the art of letter writing that can well be
found in any language. Upon them we shall principally
rely for our information about Mérimée; nor,
indeed, seeing that we have treated of him mainly in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>his character of Panizzi’s friend, should we think ourselves
justified in travelling very far beyond their contents.
Unstudied and unartificial, unrevised after
being written, as is plain from the careless repetition
that abounds in them, and written with no purpose of
meeting any eye but their recipient’s, they present a
clearer reflection of the writer’s mind than could be
obtained from more elaborate compositions.</p>

<p class='c018'>Moreover, the multitude of interesting subjects
treated in them gives them a value for general history
as well as an insight into the disposition and actions
of their author.</p>

<p class='c018'>In politics, Mérimée was of the school commonly
known as Liberal-Conservative. He seems to have
been singularly free from the gregarious instinct of
his race and countrymen, who, to genuine liberty, are
apt to prefer enforced equality, which, from the insupportable
tyranny of the mob, leads, in nine cases
out of ten, to the Despotism of the Dictator. Of the
great political principle of vesting the Sovereign power
in that quarter where the greatest number of noses
are to be counted, he had the most genuine horror, as
also of the instrument towards that end, universal
suffrage, to which he expressed fears lest the reforms at
that time projected in England should cause the nation
to drift. It is natural that he should couple the expression
of his fears with the praise of one, the moderation
of whose opinions on this point he must heartily
have approved:—</p>

<div class='quote0' style='font-size:95%' lang='fr' xml:lang='fr'>

<div class='c011'>“Cannes, 10 Mars, 1867.</div>

<p class='c018'>“En ce qui concerne la réforme, il me semble
toujours que le beau rôle est à notre ami M. Lowe.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>Lui seul est dans le vrai et a le courage de son
opinion. Ménager la chèvre et le chou est chose bien
difficile, et je ne crois pas possible de faire une réforme
définitive. Autant vaut prétendre s’arrêter au
milieu d’une glissade que de fixer les conditions du
droit électoral pour toujours ou même pour longtemps.
Si on détruit ce qui existe, on ne retardera guère le
suffrage universel.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>Happily we have not arrived as yet quite so far as
that, although could Mérimée now see us, he might
possibly be disturbed at finding that his forebodings
of evil were not wholly without foundation, and that
he was justified in predicting that tendency on our
part towards the American system of politics which
he so much disliked. Altogether he views England
and its institutions from a strong Conservative standpoint,
which position, however, enables him to be a
good deal more complimentary to us than to his own
countrymen:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“Cannes, 2 Avril, 1866.</div>

<p class='c018'>“Tout le monde devient-il fou? C’est ce que je
me demande souvent en lisant les journaux. Je ne
parle pas seulement des Allemands dont c’est l’état
habituel, mais des gens que je suis habitué à considérer
comme possesseurs de la plus haute dose de
raison qui ait été accordée à la nature humaine.
Cette affaire du ‘Reform Bill’ chez vous me semble
de plus en plus incompréhensible et je suis désolé que
Mr. Gladstone y ait mis les mains. Que cela réussisse
cette fois ou non, je ne crois pas que le vieux prestige
de l’Angleterre survive à cette épreuve. Elle est
comme un vieux bâtiment encore très solide, mais
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>qui menace de s’écrouler dès qu’on y fait des réparations
maladroites. Ce qui me frappe surtout, c’est
l’imprévoyance ou plutôt l’insouciance de l’avenir de
la part de vos hommes d’Etat. C’est tout à fait le
'furia francese’ qui cherche en tout la satisfaction
du moment. Vous paraissez croire que le ministère
se trouvera en minorité, mais on dit qu’il fera une
dissolution dans l’espoir que les élections faites sous
la pression démocratique lui seront favorables. A en
juger par le ton du <cite>Times</cite> qui semble désespérer, je
serais tenté de croire que, dans ce Parlement même,
la majorité est fort incertaine et que les Ministres
actuels ont d’assez grandes chances de succès. Vous
me parlez de Lord Stanley comme “Premier” probable,
et en même temps de M. Lowe comme devant
occuper une place importante dans un nouveau
Cabinet.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>The most old-fashioned politicians amongst us,
however they might regret the decadence of old
systems and deplore those changes which time and
necessity have forced upon us, would probably hardly
have the courage to utter such words as these:—</p>

<div class='quote0' style='font-size:95%' lang='fr' xml:lang='fr'>

<div class='c011'>“Dimanche, 13 Mai, 1866.</div>

<p class='c018'>“Je ne comprends pas grand’chose au second ‘Bill’
de réforme. Il me semble seulement que c’est un
grand coup de marteau dans le vieil édifice. Le
résultat sera de diminuer la ‘qualité’ des membres du
Parlement, laquelle n’est pas déjà si brillante. Je
vois dans les journaux qu’on se félicite de voir ôter
aux fils de grandes maisons, des bourgs qui étaient à
leur dévotion. A mon sens, c’était un des beaux côtés
de l’Angleterre que cette initiation de jeunes aristocrates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>à la vie politique dès leur sortie de l’Université.
C’est ainsi que Fox, Pitt et Lord Palmerston sont
devenus de bonne heure des hommes d’Etat. Vous
aurez en place des industriels et des négociants, c’est-à-dire
des niais et des esprits étroits, excluant systématiquement
toute grandeur de la politique. On fera
ainsi une Angleterre semi-démocratique inférieure à
beaucoup d’égards à la vraie et terrible démocratie des
Etats-Unis.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>Some of his compatriots, while admitting the <em>good
sense</em> and <em>experience</em> shown in the general proposition
contained in the following passage may not be quite
so ready to admit its application to their own particular
notions:—</p>

<div class='quote0' style='font-size:95%' lang='fr' xml:lang='fr'>

<div class='c011'>“Cannes, 22 Février, 1866.</div>

<p class='c018'>“Nous avons nos Fenians cent fois plus dangereux
et plus nombreux qu’ils ne le sont en Irlande. Donnez
à ces gens là les libertés qu’ils réclament et que M.
Thiers dit être nécessaires à tous les peuples, vous aurez
en trois mois une révolution. Le plus grand malheur
qui puisse arriver à un peuple est, je crois, d’avoir
des institutions plus avancées que son intelligence.
Lorsqu’on demande pour la France les institutions des
Anglais, il faudrait pouvoir leur donner d’abord le
bon sens et l’expérience qui les rendent praticables.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>It remains a question yet to be decided how far
this people, which imitates English institutions before
it understands them, will be competent to manage a
Republic of their own. His praise of the decision
and energy of our colonial authorities in the celebrated
Eyre and Gordon case is not unalloyed with a
dash of sarcasm, but here also there is no reason to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>doubt that what he says of his own country is meant
in earnest:—</p>

<div class='quote0' style='font-size:95%' lang='fr' xml:lang='fr'>

<div class='c011'>“Cannes, 18 Décembre, 1865.</div>

<p class='c018'>“J’admire beaucoup l’affaire de la Jamaïque.
L’Angleterre trouve toujours des hommes énergiques
à la hauteur des plus graves circonstances, et non
seulement énergiques, mais assez dévoués pour risquer
les plus grandes énormités, si elles sont nécessaires.
Il me semble qu’on a pendu beaucoup plus qu’il ne
fallait, peut-être même les gens qu’il ne fallait pas;
mais l’insurrection a été arrêtée net, et l’exemple
durera, même si l’on désavoue le gouverneur. Voilà
la véritable politique, malheureusement impratiquée
et peut-être impraticable dans ce pays-ci.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>He is not, however, it pains us to record, so lenient
a judge of English foreign policy, under Lord Russell
and Lord Palmerston, as he is a fervent admirer of the
energy of our Colonial Governors, and of the beauties
of our constitution in general. Indeed he seems occasionally
a little unnecessarily severe, as, for instance,
when he says:—</p>

<div class='quote0' style='font-size:95%' lang='fr' xml:lang='fr'>

<div class='c011'>“Paris, 14 Mars, 1865.</div>

<p class='c018'>“Est-ce la vieillesse qui règne dans le Cabinet
Britannique, ou bien est-ce calcul de gens qui ont fait
un bon coup à la Bourse et qui ne veulent plus se
risquer? Quoi qu’il en soit, vos Ministres affichent la
poltronnerie avec trop d’éclat. Rien n’est plus bête
que d’être fanfaron, mais il est dangereux, outre
ridicule, de se poser en poltron. C’est le moyen
d’avoir tous les faux braves à ses trousses.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>And in the following extracts, in reference to Lord
Palmerston, he shows himself scarcely so far-sighted
as might be expected of him:—</p>

<div class='c011'>“24 Octobre, 1865.</div>

<p class='c018'>“Reste à savoir ce que dira la postérité. Pour
moi, je crois qu’elle aura un terrible blâme pour sa
conduite dans les affaires d’Amérique; s’il eût fait
avec la France le traité qu’on lui proposait, il aurait
sauvé la vie à quelques centaines de mille yankees (ce
qui n’est pas très à regretter); mais il aurait encore
détourné de l’Europe une abominable influence qui
pourra bien un jour devenir une intervention active.”</p>

</div>

<div class='quote0' style='font-size:95%' lang='fr' xml:lang='fr'>

<div class='c011'>“Paris, 25 Juillet, 1870.</div>

<p class='c018'>“L’Angleterre a perdu son prestige en Europe.
II y a quelques années elle aurait pu empêcher la
guerre. En s’unissant à la France, elle aurait pu
diviser à jamais l’Amérique en deux états rivaux;
elle aurait pu prévenir la scandaleuse invasion du
Danemark, et aujourd’hui nous serions probablement
tranquilles.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>On the case of Denmark we refrain from remarking,
but the policy recommended towards America
might have been hard for that country, and assuredly
would have been worse for England, however much
some amongst us may have admired the chivalry of
the South, and mistrusted the declared motives of
those who (there never could have been much doubt
at the time) would in the long run have come victorious
out of the struggle. Few could seriously suppose
that the power of England, even had there been
a means of exercising it, would have been of much
avail to prevent the ill-feeling which Mérimée admits
to have been long smouldering between France and
Germany from breaking out into war. After this
criticism of our own, it is but fair to record a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>tribute to Lord Palmerston’s worth in another
letter:—</p>

<div class='quote0' style='font-size:95%' lang='fr' xml:lang='fr'>

<div class='c011'>“Paris, 24 Octobre, 1865.</div>

telle que je la voudrais pour moi et pour mes amis.
Il a été l’homme le plus heureux de ce siècle. Il a

d’amis. Il laisse un grand nom et un souvenir
ineffaçable chez ceux qui l’ont connu. Si vous
trouvez moyen de me nommer à Lady Palmerston
quand vous la verrez, vous m’obligerez. Vous pouvez
lui dire qu’ici la presse a été unanime dans ses éloges.
On a fait, bien entendu, force <span lang="en" xml:lang="en"><em>blunders</em></span> historiques et
autres, à cette occasion, entre autres de dire que Lady
Palmerston était morte, etc., etc., mais il n’y a pas eu
de méchancetés d’aucune part, et dans tous les partis
on a été respectueux; c’est un hommage bien rare en
France, comme vous savez. L’Empereur et l’Impératrice
ont montré beaucoup de regret en petit

</div>

<p class='c018'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>De omnibus rebus et quibusdam aliis</i></span> might be the
collective title, and may be truly called the proper
text of Mérimée’s letters to Panizzi. But it would be
as hopeless to attempt to follow the critic <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>omnium
rerum, et quarundam aliarum</i></span>, through all the variations
of English politics that happened in his time, as
to review the numerous works with which he has
amused and instructed mankind, or to recount the
offices he filled, from his place in the Senate of France
and his membership of the “Académie Française” to
his office of Commissioner at the London Exhibition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>of 1862, or the several ways in which he did good
service to art and to the State. One subject, then,
only shall be added on what may be called public
politics, viz., an opinion on the Eastern question,
which, even if Mérimée’s prophecy has not been
actually fulfilled according to the very letter, shows, at
least, a pretty sound notion of the stability of the
Turkish Empire:—</p>

<div class='quote0' style='font-size:95%' lang='fr' xml:lang='fr'>

<div class='c011'>“Paris, 3 Septembre, 1861.</div>

<p class='c018'>“J’ai eu des nouvelles de Constantinople, où l’on se
moque beaucoup des histoires qu’on a faites de la

L’un est aussi vrai que l’autre; mais son grand goût
pour le moment, c’est pour les poules. Il vient de
commander un poulailler de cinq cent mille francs
pour élever ses volailles. Voilà comme il entend
l’économie! Croyez que nous aurons, d’ici à peu de
temps, des choses sérieuses en Orient, qui donneront
un cruel démenti à Lord Palmerston, lequel veut
absolument que l’Empire Turc se tienne debout tant
qu’il vivra. Je crois la Porte beaucoup plus près de
sa fin que Mylord.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>Mérimée was an author before he attained his
twenty-second year. He wrote a collection of plays,
published under the pseudonym of Clara Gazul, a
Spanish authoress, and alleged to be translated by
Joseph L’Estrange, an equally fictitious personage.
Concerning this book and its originator, we quote
the words of a writer of the time:—</p>

<div class='quote0' style='font-size:95%' lang='fr' xml:lang='fr'>

<p class='c018'>“Ceux qui n’étaient pas dans le secret auraient
difficilement reconnu un jeune homme à ces caractères
dessinés avec tant de précision et de relief, à
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>cette absence de déclamation, à ce style correct, ferme
et nerveux, qui ne trahissait nulle part l’hésitation
d’un débutant.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>One of the best imaginary plays was entitled <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Les
Espagnols en Danemark,”</span> and was a satire directed
by Mérimée against the extravagant laudation bestowed
by certain people from hatred to the restoration
on the régime of the first Napoleon. Whatever
Mérimée may have thought of the First, he was on
the best of terms with the ruler of the Second Empire.
It would perhaps be a little rash as yet to
assert positively that the last of the dynasty who had
the slightest chance of attaining to future eminence
has passed away, but it is a truism that requires no
apology that it will be long ere the past fortunes of
the house lose their interest for the reader of history,
and some of the many anecdotes and other matters
related in his letters to Panizzi by Mérimée, who was
a constant guest of the Emperor and Empress, wherein
he describes the inner life of the family, may be
profitably reproduced. Here is an account of an
innocent practical joke played on an enthusiastic
German lady, which must have afforded some amusement
to the perpetrators of it:—</p>

<div class='quote0' style='font-size:95%' lang='fr' xml:lang='fr'>

<div class='c011'>“Paris, 13 Octobre, 1805.</div>

<p class='c018'>“Madame de L—— en sa qualité d’Allemande
admirait fort M. de Bismark, et nous la tourmentions
en la menaçant des hardiesses de ce grand homme
qu’elle semblait encourager. Il y a quelques jours
j’ai peint et découpé la tête de M. de Bismark très
ressemblante, et le soir Leurs Majestés et moi nous
sommes entrés dans la chambre de Madame de L——
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>Nous avons mis la tête sur le lit, un traversin sous les
draps pour représenter la bosse formée par un corps
humain, puis l’Impératrice a mis sur le front un
mouchoir arrangé comme bonnet de nuit. Dans le
demi-jour de la chambre, l’illusion était complète.
Quand Leurs Majestés se sont retirées, nous avons
retenu quelque temps Madame de L—— pour que
l’Empereur et l’Impératrice allassent se poster au
bout du corridor, puis chacun a fait mine d’entrer
dans sa chambre. Madame de L—— est entrée
dans la sienne, y est restée, puis en est sortie précipitamment
et est venue frapper à la porte de
Madame de X——, en lui disant d’une voix lamentable:
“Il y a un homme dans mon lit!” Malheureusement
Madame de X—— n’a pas gardé son sérieux,
et à l’autre bout du corridor, les rires de l’Impératrice
ont tout gâté. Le bon est ce que nous avons appris
plus tard. Un des valets de pied de l’Empereur était
entré dans la chambre de Madame de L—— et
apercevant la tête s’était retiré avec de grandes
excuses. Puis il était allé dire qu’il y avait un homme
dans le lit. Quelques uns avaient émis l’opinion que
c’était M. de L—— qui venait pour coucher avec
sa femme, mais cette hypothèse avait été rejetée
comme improbable. Eugène qui m’avait vu fabriquer
le portrait a empêché qu’on n’allat vérifier l’affaire.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Concerning the unfortunate Prince

in arts and arms, which his early life
indicated:—</p>

  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c018'>These letters to Panizzi must not, however, cause
us to lose ourselves in a labyrinth of quotations and
remarks.</p>

<p class='c018'>It is to be feared that enough has already been
placed before the reader to spoil his enjoyment of the
collection itself, and more than enough to fulfil our
own purpose of throwing light on Mérimée’s life and
opinions from the letters themselves. By no means
always, but certainly sometimes, it has happened that
absolute dependence on some more solid reward than
popular applause has tended to fetter the pen of a
brilliant writer. It is equally true that what is done
by men for their diversion is frequently of superior
merit to that which is the product of sheer necessity,
and we have often thought, though this, we admit,
may be but fancy, that the peculiar facility conspicuous
throughout Mérimée’s works might be traced
to the fact that, being placed by fortune above necessity,
he wrote as one in no way enforced, and as much
for his own pleasure as for the amusement of his
readers. The style of some of his lighter works, it
may be remarked <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>en passant</i></span>, reminds one strongly of
some of Voltaire’s <cite>Romans</cite>, than which there can
assuredly be no higher praise.</p>

<p class='c018'>Of artist blood on the side both of his father and
mother, he inherited much of his parents’ ability,
and has left behind a goodly stock of productions, of
which (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Exceptis Excipiendis</i></span> for one, at least, might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>be objected to on the ground of propriety) it is
much to be wished that a collection could be
made.</p>

<p class='c018'>Readers of these letters to Panizzi, and, indeed, of
other of Mérimée’s works, can hardly fail to notice how
greatly he, in common with his friend and correspondent,
was affected by a malady, and that no imaginary
one, common enough amongst the Roman Catholic
nations, but little known in this country—the hatred
of priests.</p>

<p class='c018'>Nor is it much to be wondered at that, in countries
where the Church seems to exist for itself alone, and
not for that purpose for which it is supposed to have
been founded—the benefit of mankind—where it
dwells as a foreign authority, ever busied in jealously
watching the temporal power, and opposing all that
may be done for the cause of civilization and political
advancement, simply because done by the State—the
well-drilled officials of such a system should be viewed
by the patriot and statesman, by a Panizzi, a Mérimée,
or a Cavour, with mistrust and dislike. The letter to
Panizzi, however, announcing the death and burial of
Mérimée, with which this chapter concludes, shows a
result not always brought about by this feeling of
hatred of priests; yet we cannot but think that
Mérimée had ceased to be a Roman Catholic in the
strict sense of the term, rather than become a Protestant
of any kind, and that his express desire for the
place and manner of his burial is to be taken more as
a protest against the creed of his birth than as a sign
of his acceptance of any other. However this may
be, it is hard to acquit the priests of the charge of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>alienating yet another eminent man from that communion.</p>

<p class='c018'>Mérimée suffered greatly during the last years of
his life, and for a long time before his death was, according
to his letters to Panizzi, in something like a
moribund state, enduring, in fact, a living death:—</p>

Our book approaches the end. Such
materials as we have deemed it expedient
to use in recording the events
of a laborious life are almost exhausted,
and it is necessary to look around and
see that nothing has been omitted which may tend to
illustrate Panizzi’s unaspiring yet truly estimable
character. Had he sought worldly distinctions he
might have had more than his share of such unenduring
and too often unmerited tokens of flattery. Those
that he did accept were for the most part received
with extreme shyness, if not with genuine reluctance.
They were forced upon him, nor did he assume them
until he was out of office.</p>

<p class='c018'>In the autumn of 1865, Panizzi received a letter
from Signor Nicomede Bianchi, announcing that the
King of Italy desired to create him a Senator of the
Kingdom. Conscious of his official position, he felt
great difficulty and delicacy in accepting the high
honour intended to be conferred upon him, and
applied to Mr. Gladstone, as was his almost invariable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>custom, for guidance and advice. He received the
following answer:—</p>

    <div class='group'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>“Upon reading your very interesting letter, I, like
you, feel myself in a strait. I am loth to say anything
that may tend to even your partial removal
from among us; yet I cannot doubt that if a fair
regard to your health and personal comfort will permit,
you should accept the offer of the King of Italy.
I know not what will be the precise effect on the convenience
of the existing Administration, or even on
the Museum. But without stopping—for I must not
stop—to ask, I think that, considering the difficulty and
importance of constituting a Second Chamber or Senate
and of doing it in the best manner, and the advantage
to it of your character, prowess, long English experience,
and thorough knowledge of our constitution,
I feel that you have before you a door opened for
rendering great services to your <em>other</em> country in the
hour of her need, and that such an opportunity cannot
be generously refused, though I hope acceptance
will not practically remove you from us. I rather
blush while writing thus. Perhaps you will consult
some other friend. On my own responsibility I mentioned
the matter recently to my host. He agrees
with me.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The great Italian question needs all the strength
that can be applied to it ... I must not omit
to say that while I have written the first part of this
letter with very mixed feelings, I dwell with unmingled
pleasure on the high and honourable and most just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>tribute which this offer pays to your character, abilities,
and distinctions.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>Three years afterwards—on the 12th of March,
1868—Victor Emmanuel confirmed the proposed appointment,
and on the 22nd of April following made
Panizzi a Commander of the Order of the Crown of
Italy. A letter, dated April 15th, to Mrs. Haywood,
refers to this subject:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“It is more than three years that I am offered to
be made a Senator in Italy, it is a great honour. I
begged to be excused, and I only accepted it when it
was offered by the present Minister Menabrea, a man
of honour and character. The offer came after the
Mentana affair, that is at the time that poor Italy was
most unfairly run down by everybody. I did not
think I ought to shrink from doing what I could for
my native country at such a moment, and had I not
been taken ill as I was, I should have gone at once to
take my seat.”</p>

<p class='c018'>The last words refer to an attack which, in January,
1868, reached a climax so severe that his life was
despaired of by his medical advisers. His friends
were unremitting in their attentions; amongst them
may be specially named Mr. Winter Jones, Mr. Newton,
Sir James Lacaita, and Mr. C. Cannon. The
sufferer rallied, and when he had attained sufficient
strength went for a short time to Hastings, the air of
which watering-place greatly benefited him.</p>

<p class='c018'>This illness must not be dismissed from notice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>without placing before our readers a most characteristic
extract from a “Memorandum” which speaks
for itself:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“31, Bloomsbury Square,</div>
      <div class='line in17'>April 14, 1868.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>“It having come to my knowledge that during my
last illness a <em>priest</em>, who had never been called in by
me or by my orders, pushed himself into my
house, when he was with great difficulty hindered
from forcing himself into my bedroom, where I was
lying very ill, he alleging that he had been sent by
some nameless or unknown person; in order to prevent
so vile and so impudent an attempt from being
successful if repeated, I warmly beseech my medical
attendants, as well as my true friends, and I order
my servants to forbid by all means in their power any
person not sent for by me, or not known as one whose
visit I should like to receive, from having access to
my presence, were he unfortunately admitted into the
house.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>It may seem strange to some that Panizzi thus
strongly and decidedly expressed himself in regard to
a priest of his own Church: it can scarcely appear,
however, in this light to any one who has attentively
studied his character, as pourtrayed in these pages.
However disinterested might be the zeal of the Roman
clergy—and even of this the sick man seems to have
had some little doubt—the officious importunity of
this particular ecclesiastic was hardly fitted to commend
him to the patient, whom an assumption of
spiritual authority would have disgusted at all times;
it was, therefore, but natural that he should resent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>the attempted intrusion of a stranger on his presumed
helplessness.</p>

<p class='c018'>He knew all the insidious arts of the Church to
which he nominally belonged, and of the religion
which he always professed; at the same time he was
perfectly aware of the character of the doctrines
which, even with the best intentions, the most worthy
of the Romish priesthood are bound to inculcate.
Knowing all this, he avoided controversy on the subject:
if it were introduced in conversation, he would
say, <em>I am a Roman Catholic</em>, and there was an end.
Such being his ordinary frame of mind, his indignation
was aroused at any attempt to pester him on
analogous themes in his state of prostration.</p>

<p class='c018'>No more need be said here to account for the peremptoriness
of the “Memorandum.”</p>

<p class='c018'>About this period Panizzi wrote from Montpellier
to the biographer, then travelling in South America:—“As
you know, I have been very ill, and I really
thought I should not see you again. I hear you are
likely to come back. My expenses are frightful, or I
should offer to pay your voyage. This climate, or
rather Italy, would suit me very well; I could not
live in France. The French, and especially the Emperor,
have behaved very ill, perhaps cruelly to Italy.
On the other hand, the Italians have acted like idiots.
I should pass my time arguing and getting angry: so,
if I can succeed, I shall return to England; but probably
I shall die on the road.“</p>

<p class='c018'>The present writer returned in June, 1869, and
with great regret clearly perceived the ravages in his
friend’s appearance caused by the late severe illness.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>Many attempts had been made by friends to induce
Panizzi to allow his name to be proposed to the committee
of the Athenæum Club for election as a member.
Sir Roderick Murchison wrote to him “that he
would really be much gratified in seeing those services
recognised in the manner he proposed by his
(Panizzi’s) contemporaries in science, art, and letters.”
To this proposal, honourable as it was, he did not
accede. Sir Roderick did not allow the matter to
drop, but, in the beginning of 1866, wrote again
pressing the subject on his consideration thus: “The
moment has arrived when the men of letters, science,
and art, who constitute the committee of the
Athenæum Club, <em>ought</em> to recognise your merit by
electing you as a member on our list of <em>eminently distinguished</em>
candidates.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Hereupon Panizzi overcame his scruples, and acquiesced
in the proposal. Sir Roderick was very
much gratified, a feeling shared by the Dean of St.
Paul’s, as the words of the former show. He said he
“was so fortunate as to meet the Dean of St. Paul’s,
who joyfully became the seconder, saying that he
never signed any document whatever with greater
satisfaction.”</p>

<p class='c018'>An unforeseen difficulty, however, arose, which Sir
Roderick thus communicated:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“February 6th, 1866.</div>

<p class='c018'>“My dear Panizzi,</p>

<p class='c019'>“My efforts have been frustrated, to my deep
regret, and that of all those men of eminence in science,
letters, and art, whose opinion you value. After I saw you,
accident placed me in the position to ascertain that <em>no arguments</em>
of mine would or could change the resolve of one of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>Committee to <em>veto</em> your election, in case you obtained a
majority of votes; and therefore, after giving the strongest
reasons I could for thinking that you were singularly and
highly qualified to be selected as one of our eminent nine, I
withdrew your name.</p>

<p class='c018'>The reason assigned for this opposition was, that as you
were unpopular with a certain number of men in the Club <em>at
large</em>, the Committee ought not to go against their feelings.</p>

<p class='c018'>I protested against this doctrine on my own part; the
more so as the gentleman, who acted in a frank and honourable
manner in letting me know his resolve, had assured me
that he had a high opinion of your capacity, acquirements,
and character.</p>

<p class='c018'>The result has given me great pain; for though your selection
as a member of the Athenæum could be of no real value
to you, and could not have added an iota to your well-earned
and high reputation, it would have been a true gratification
to myself to have had the opportunity of meeting you more
frequently, now that you have retired from the office in which
you have so distinguished yourself.</p>

<p class='c018'>I may add that Sir Stafford Northcote and Lord Stanhope
both expressed their regret that the step I took was rendered
imperative, and many others have since spoken to me in the
same sense.</p>

<p class='c018'>I enclose the letters of the Dean of St. Paul’s and Mr. Grote,
whose sentiments I expressed to the meeting; assuring my
auditors that the Trustees of the British Museum would endorse

<p class='c018'>“My dear Sir Roderick,</p>

<p class='c019'>I greatly rejoice that you are about to propose
our friend Panizzi for election at the Athenæum.</p>

<p class='c018'>I know few persons for whom, if on the Committee, I should
have voted with a more clear conscience, or with more earnest
desire for success.</p>

<p class='c018'>As a man of letters I know few persons with a more extensive
knowledge of literature; as an author, his introduction
to the edition of Bojardo and Ariosto, containing a most masterly
view of Italian poetry, is, I believe, his chief claim.
But I have read other scattered works, perhaps less generally
known, which I hold in high estimation. As to his public
services, his long and most useful connection with the British
Museum, cannot be more justly or fully appreciated than by
yourself, and I am sure that we should entirely agree on this
subject; above all, the great national gift of the Reading-Room,
the envy and admiration of Europe, is, as you well
know, almost his entire creation, from the original design to
the most minute detail, from the dome to the inkstands and
book-shelves.</p>

<p class='c018'>I most heartily, my dear Murchison, wish you success, and
remain ever most truly yours,</p>

<p class='c019'>Many thanks for the trouble you have taken in
my behalf. The result is what I expected, and I am not in
the least affected by it. I am only sorry for the pain that I
know it must have given you.</p>

<p class='c018'>I am proud of having received on this occasion additional

<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>to which your colleague in the Committee says I am

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c018'>In the summer of 1861, Sir G. Cornewall Lewis,
then Home Secretary, sought to confer another
honour on Panizzi in offering him knighthood, which,
however, he declined in these terms (July 23rd,
1861):—</p>

<p class='c018'>“I can hardly find words to acknowledge as I ought
your unexpected communication of to-day. Her
Majesty’s approbation of my humble services at the
Museum is the highest reward I ever desired to receive
for them. I can only regret my inability adequately
to express my dutiful gratitude for Her Majesty’s condescension.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Permit me, however, to represent most respectfully
that, occupying as I do, through Her Majesty’s
goodness, the honourable position I now fill, I feel
great unwillingness to be the object of a further
mark of Royal favour which may attract too much
public attention to one like myself, a foreigner by
birth, who will be considered by many to have already
received too high a reward for his exertions.</p>

<p class='c018'>“If, therefore, I may be allowed to give utterance
to my feelings on the subject, I humbly but earnestly
beg to be excused from having an honour bestowed
on me, the value of which I fully appreciate and unfeignedly
regard as far beyond my deserts. Apart
from all other considerations, I feel an instinctive
shrinking from all distinctions of this nature.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>“With the utmost thankfulness to you for having
advised Her Majesty to acknowledge in so gracious a
manner the public services which you are pleased to
state I have rendered at the Museum, I remain, &amp;c.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Still the Government cherished the idea of conferring
on him some title of honour; for, on the 27th of
June, 1866, Lord Russell informed him that Her
Majesty had offered a <em>C.B., as a recognition, though
slight, of his services to one of our great public Institutions</em>.
With many thanks Panizzi reminded his
Lordship of what had taken place several years before,
and again declined the proferred distinction. However,
in 1869, the Queen conferred on him the distinction
of K.C.B. In addition to this he was, in the
month of August of the same year, unanimously
elected member of Parliament for the place of his
birth. This onerous position he, however, found it
out of his power to accept.</p>

<p class='c018'>Here we will pause for a few minutes, as we have
now arrived at the beginning, as it were, of the end of
this remarkable career. As strength failed, and
Panizzi no longer possessed his pristine powers of
body, his life became more retired; indeed, from the
year 1870 up to the time of his death it may be said
that he remained in strict privacy. It is true that his
friends, his intimates, continued as of old to visit him,
nor did they omit to do so to the last; but his facility
for correspondence had failed. The old pain in
his hand had increased, until it was only with extreme
difficulty that he could use his pen; and, for the last
few years, he could do no more than append an almost
illegible signature to what was written for him.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>During this time his only occupation in the daytime
was reading; Dante, Virgil, and Scott’s novels
were his chief favourites. In the evening he was
glad to see around his table those who still clung to
him. Such as had been most in his confidence at the
Museum were always welcome, and other old friends
occasionally joined them. Then there was the whist
party, with a very moderate stake to encourage attention
to the game, and the company dispersed with pleasant
recollections.</p>

<p class='c018'>Amongst those who did not forget Panizzi in his
latter days was the late Emperor of the French; he
paid him several visits, as did other foreign Princes
when in London.</p>

<p class='c018'>Not the least distinguished of the number was
King Humbert, then Prince of Savoy, and lastly, his
old and constant friend, Mr. Gladstone, who, when in
town, never failed to pay his afternoon visit, frequently
stopping to dinner, and cheering him with
his intellectual conversation.</p>

<p class='c018'>Nor were his declining days uncheered by sympathisers
and comforters of the gentler sex, whose
consciences still bear the impress of their good deeds.
One only will we mention here—Lady Holland, whose
innate gentleness and kindness of heart prompted her
to anticipate and administer in many ways to wants
and wishes that only a long and intimate acquaintance
could have enabled her to understand. Having
watched him throughout his arduous journey in life,
who could have been better fitted to solace him, and
how could she fail to be greatly attached to one
whose character she had studied and knew so well?</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>On the Friday previous to Panizzi’s death, Mr.
Gladstone called for the last time. A sudden
change for the worse was too marked to escape
observation, and from that evening it was certain
that the weary traveller was nearing his rest.
He lay in a state of perfect composure, and in the
afternoon of the next Tuesday, the 8th of April,
1879, his spirit passed from the scene of his long unceasing
labours. His body remains for the present
under a marble tomb in St. Mary’s Catholic Cemetery
at Kensal Green, where it was deposited on Saturday,
the 12th of April, 1879, in the presence of many
friends and admirers besides the recognized mourners.</p>

<p class='c018'>So died Sir Anthony Panizzi, mourned for by all
who knew him, and by men of genius especially; no
one, in discussing his merits or demerits, can ascribe
to him a spark of selfishness. The best part of his
life had been devoted to one great object; that object
he had attained and enjoyed. He had been rewarded
by the appreciation of thinking men, and by the
comforts that should accompany old age, <em>love, honour,
and troops of friends</em>.</p>

<p class='c018'>His death was the loss of a staunch friend to the
biographer, who etched the portrait prefixed to this
life, and on presenting Mr. Gladstone with the identical
proof which he had before given to Panizzi,
received from the eminent Statesman this gratifying
note:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<div class='c011'>“73, Harley-street, May 10th, 1879.</div>

<p class='c018'>“I thank you very sincerely for favouring me with
a copy of your etching of Sir A. Panizzi. It carries
us back considerably, I think, in our recollections of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>his general appearance from the sad wreck we lately
saw, but it is a most interesting record of one whose
image none of his friends who truly appreciated his
fine manful character would be content to part with.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>In conclusion the author cannot more faithfully
indicate the scene which terminated the labours, the
hopes, the fears, and the aspirations of his revered
friend than by quoting these memorable lines in the
language he loved so well and so keenly appreciated:—</p>

<p class='c021'>It is thought that the following document, written in
Count Cavour’s own hand, may interest the reader.
It is well known that the Italian Statesman was in
the habit of supplying Panizzi from time to time with
information, for the purpose of publication in the
English newspapers.</p>

<div class='quote0' style='font-size:95%' lang='fr' xml:lang='fr'>

<div class='c011'>(1852?)</div>

<p class='c018'>“Peu de pays se sont trouvés placés dans une
situation financière plus difficile que ne l’a été la Sardaigne
après la désastreuse campagne du printemps
1849. Avec un trésor vide, le Gouvernement avait à
songer à faire face aux frais de l’occupation étrangère
qui dura plusieurs mois, à liquider les frais de deux
guerres malheureuses, à fournir des secours aux nombreux
infortunés qui venaient chercher en Piémont
un refuge contre les atteintes de la réaction, partout
ailleurs triomphante en Italie.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>Plus tard il eut à pourvoir au payement de l’énorme
indemnité de guerre stipulée en faveur de l’Autriche
par la paix de Milan, et il dut songer à poursuivre les
grands travaux publics entrepris par Charles-Albert
qu’on n’eût pu interrompre sans éprouver d’immenses
dommages.</p>

<p class='c018'>Quand ou songe que toutes ces difficultés étaient
aggravées encore par l’existence d’un papier ayant
cours forcé, on sera forcé de convenir que M. d’Azeglio
et ses collègues, en acceptant le pouvoir le lendemain
de la bataille de Novara, firent preuve d’un grand
courage et d’un dévouement sans bornes à leur Roi
et à leur pays.</p>

<p class='c018'>Le nouveau Ministre des Finances, M. Nigra, pourvit
aux premiers besoins par un emprunt volontaire;
par la vente de quelques rentes, anciennes propriétés
des finances, et l’émission de bons du trésor, qui, sans
avoir cours forcé, furent acceptés sans murmures par
les employés du Gouvernement et les fournisseurs de
l’armée.</p>

<p class='c018'>Quelques mois plus tard, le calme et la confiance
étant rétablis, toute crainte de réaction ayant disparu,
grâce à la loyauté du jeune Roi, le Ministre jugea le
moment venu pour contracter un emprunt à
l’étranger.</p>

<p class='c018'>Il parvint à le faire, à des conditions, qui eu égard
aux circonstances financières et économiques de
l’Europe, peuvent être considérées comme avantageuses.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>Ce premier emprunt, négocié en Octobre, 1849,
avec Mess. de Rothschild, fut suivi de deux emprunts
contractés également avec cette maison l’année
suivante. Avec les ressources qu’ils procurèrent au
trésor, il fut possible de solder avec exactitude l’indemnité
de guerre due à l’Autriche; de liquider les
dépenses arriérées des deux campagnes de 1848 et
1849, et enfin de pousser avec vigueur les travaux des
deux grandes lignes de chemin de fer qui coupent le
pays en forme de croix; celle de Turin à Gênes, et
de Gênes au Lac Majeur.</p>

<p class='c018'>Mais ce n’était pas tout que de pourvoir aux
besoins extraordinaires par des ressources extraordinaires,
comme les emprunts et les bons du trésor; le
Gouvernement devait songer à augmenter d’une
manière permanente les recettes du trésor, afin de
faire face aux charges que les nouveaux emprunts
imposeraient dorénavant a l’Etat. Pour cela il
fallait se résoudre à établir de nouveaux impôts.</p>

<p class='c018'>Le Ministère ne recula pas devant cette tâche ingrate;
rendue extrêmement difficile par la nécessité
d’obtenir le concours franc et décidé d’une Chambre
des <a id='corr315.23'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Deputés'>Députés</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_315.23'><ins class='correction' title='Deputés'>Députés</ins></a></span> jeune et sans expérience; qui devait
nécessairement éprouver la plus vive répugnance à
débuter dans ses travaux parlementaires, en imposant
de nouvelles charges à ses commettants.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dans la session de 1850, le Ministre des Finances
obtint une augmentation sur les droits d’enrégistrement,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>et une extension des droits de timbre.
La session suivante, le Parlement vota une nouvelle
taxe sur les maisons; une taxe sur le commerce et
l’industrie; un impôt sur les revenus possédés par des
corps moraux; enfin une augmentation considérable
dans les droits de succession tant en ligne directe que
collatérale. Enfin dans la session actuelle, le successeur
de M. Nigra, le Comte de Cavour, a proposé un
nouvel impôt personnel et mobilier; l’augmentation
d’un quart de l’impôt foncier; l’extension à toutes les
provinces de l’Etat des droits de consommation sur le
vin, et enfin plusieurs modifications aux lois sur l’enrégistrement
et le timbre, destinées à rendre plus productives
ces deux branches importantes du revenu de
l’Etat.</p>

<p class='c018'>Les lois d’impôt votées en 1850 et 1851 ont déjà
augmenté de 10 millions les ressources de l’Etat:
celles que le Parlement discute dans ce moment
doivent produire une somme de 10 autres millions
encore.</p>

<p class='c018'>Le budget des recettes de 1847 s’élevait à la somme
de 87,000,000. Celui de l’année courante, calculé à
102,000,000 à raison de l’augmentation de la consommation
du tabac sur 1847, et du nouveau produit pour
le chemin de fer de Turin à Arquata, atteindra en définitive
le chiffre de 104,000,000 à cause du majeur
produit des impôts indirectes. Celui de l’année prochaine
<a id='corr316.28'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='s’élévera'>s’élèvera</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_316.28'><ins class='correction' title='s’élévera'>s’élèvera</ins></a></span> probablement à 114,000. Et celui
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>de 1854, époque à laquelle le grand réseau de
chemins de fer entrepris par le Gouvernement sera
achevé, il atteindra certainement le chiffre de
117,000,000.</p>

<p class='c018'>Malgré ces augmentations successives de recettes,
on ne peut pas dire que le budget de 1854 présentera
un parfait équilibre; car, sans se faire illusion, on ne
saurait calculer les dépenses de cette année à moins de
120,000,000. Bien entendu que dans cette somme
les dépenses des grands travaux publics ne sont pas
comprises. Mais par contre dans le 120,000,000 se
trouvent comprises les dépenses pour une armée de
terre de 40 et plus mille hommes, et pour une augmentation
de celle de mer, ainsi que pour autres
dépenses improductives, qui ne pesaient pas en 1847.
Toutefois lorsque le déficit apparent sera réduit à 3
ou 4 millions, on pourra dire qu’en réalité il n’existe
pas. En effet la somme portée au budget de l’année
courante pour fond d’amortissement s’élève à 7 millions;
en 1854 elle sera plus considérable encore, et
il s’en suit que si en 1854 le déficit ne dépasse pas 6
millions, il sera inférieur à la somme consacrée à
l’extinction de nos anciennes dettes.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dans cet état de choses, il suffirait pour présenter
un budget en parfait équilibre, d’adopter le système
que l’Angleterre pratique depuis plus de trente ans,
en ne consacrant à l’amortissement que le surplus
constaté des recettes sur les dépenses.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>Pour arriver à ce résultat de grands sacrifices
étaient et seront encore nécessaires. Il a fallu se
résigner à augmenter les charges qui pesaient sur les
contribuables avant les derniers événements de plus
du 30%. Les impôts en 1847 étaient de entre 78 et
80 millions; ils seraient portés entre 108 et 110 millions.
Les nouveaux impôts ont été votés et sont
discutés par le Parlement avec un admirable patriotisme.
Le pays les supporte avec une rare résignation;
cela est dû à ce que le Piémont payait fort peu
d’impôts en égard aux autres nations d’Europe, et que
même avec tous les impôts susénoncés il payera toujours
moins qu’en France, ayant égard à la population et à
la richesse territoriale.</p>

<p class='c018'>Cependant devant faire cette augmentation d’impôts
aussi rapidement en peu d’années, il était à craindre
qu’ils ne tarissent les sources de la richesse publique
et qu’ils apportassent une crise, si l’on laissait subsister
l’ancien système économique, fondé sur les principes
de l’école protectioniste. C’est ce que le Ministère
Sarde a senti. Aussi s’est-il décidé à mener de front
et les lois de finance et les lois de réforme économique.
Dès l’année 1840 il proclame résolument son
<a id='corr318.24'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='intentention'>intention</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_318.24'><ins class='correction' title='intentention'>intention</ins></a></span> d’appliquer le système du libre échange,
en modifiant successivement toutes les lois qui avaient
été faites dans le seul but de protéger quelques industries
privilégiées.</p>

<p class='c018'>Le Ministère débuta par l’abolition des droits différentiels
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>de navigation. L’honneur de cette première
mais décisive mesure appartient à un homme qui par
le sublime courage déployé à son lit de mort a prouvé
comment on pouvait allier, au sein du Catholicisme,
les sentiments religieux les plus vrai et les plus purs,
avec une indépendance complète de la Cour de Rome;
au noble et généreux Sainte Rose,<a id='rL' /><a href='#fL' class='c015'><sup>[L]</sup></a> dont le Piémont,
après deux ans, pleure encore la perte.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='fL'>
<p class='c018'><a href='#rL'>L</a>. Count Pietro di Santa Rosa, Statesman.</p>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Dans la même session le Ministre Azeglio faisait
sanctionner la réforme du tarif postal, au moyen de
laquelle le système de la taxe unique a été substitué
en Piémont, comme il l’avait été en Angleterre, aux
droits progressifs en raison de la distance....</p>

<p class='c018'>Aucune des industries qu’on disait devoir être
frappées de mort par la concurrence étrangère n’a
succombé. Quelques unes ont éprouvé un peu de
gêne, des difficultés plus ou moins grandes dans leurs
opérations. D’autres au contraire n’ont jamais été
dans un état plus prospère que depuis qu’elles ont
cessé d’être énormément protégées.</p>

<p class='c018'>Nous citerons surtout les filatures et les manufactures
de coton. Les fileurs, qui un moment s’étaient
crûs ruinés, ayant repris courage améliorèrent leurs
modes de fabrication, perfectionnèrent leurs machines,
et par là ils réussirent non seulement à soutenir sur
nos propres marchés la concurrence anglaise, mais
encore à la faire aux produits étrangers sur les
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>marchés des pays voisins et notamment ceux des
Duchés de Parme et de Modène.</p>

<p class='c018'>L’état des importations des cotons en laine prouve
que cette assertion est loin d’être exagérée:—</p>

<p class='c018'>Ces chiffres nous paraissent d’une éloquence irrésistible.
Ces résultats d’ailleurs n’ont rien d’étonnant, si
l’on réfléchit que nos industriels tirant la matière première
directement de l’Amérique, elle ne leur revient
pas plus chère qu’aux Anglais, grâce aux bas prix
auxquels naviguent les marins Sardes; que la main
d’&oelig;uvre est meilleur marché qu’à Manchester, et enfin
que la force motrice qu’ils employent leur est fournie
gratuitement par la nature. Avec ces éléments de
prospérité, il n’est pas douteux que l’industrie du coton
est appelée à prendre en Sardaigne un immense développement,
et à être une des sources principales de la
richesse du pays.</p>

<p class='c018'>L’industrie des laines a été plus ébranlée que celle
du coton. Peut-être parce qu’ayant été plus protégée,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>elle était relativement à celle-ci dans un état plus
arriéré. Cependant elle ne présente aucun signe de
décadence: au contraire, à en juger par le nombre et
la perfection des machines que depuis quelques mois

<p class='c018'>Ces chiffres prouvent à l’évidence que la réforme
radicale opérée dans le tarif, loin de causer un préjudice
au trésor, lui a été singulièrement avantageuse;
qu’en définitive elle a augmenté les recettes de l’Etat,
tout en procurant un énorme soulagement aux contribuables.</p>

<p class='c018'>Ce que les contribuables ont gagné ne peut pas
être évalué à moins de 7 ou 8 millions par an. En
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>effet si les anciens tarifs étaient encore en vigueur,
les importations effectuées dans les derniers 12 mois,
auraient dû supporter une surtaxe équivalente à la
somme susindiquée.</p>

<p class='c018'>Si le trésor malgré ce bénéfice réalisé par les contribuables
n’a pas perdu, c’est que la quantité des
objets soumis aux droits a énormément augmenté.</p>

<p class='c018'>Il ne faut pas croire toutefois que la consommation
se soit accrue dans la proportion des chiffres que
nous venons de citer. L’augmentation des recettes
de la douane est due en grande partie à la diminution
de la contrebande qui a presque entièrement cessé,
tandis que par le passé elle s’opérait sur une immense
échelle.</p>

<p class='c018'>L’étendue des frontières des Etats Sardes par
rapport à la surface de son territoire; la facilité
qu’offre au commerce illicite la plupart des lignes
qui les séparent des pays étrangers, faisaient que
sous l’appâts de droits très élevés, la contrebande avait
pris un énorme développement. Le Ministre des
Finances dans la discussion des traités avait évalué
l’importance des marchandises importées en fraude au
tiers des importations totales; l’expérience est venue
confirmer cette assertion qui ne reposait que sur des
données approximatives.</p>

<p class='c018'>La cessation presque complète de la contrebande ne
sera certainement pas estimée par tous les hommes
qui pensent que les intérêts moraux des populations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>ne sent pas moins sacrés que leurs intérêts matériels,
comme un des moindres bienfaits de la grande réforme
que le Piémont a accomplie à l’instar de la
Grande Bretagne.</p>

<p class='c018'>Encouragé par le succès qui avait couronné ses
premières mesures, le Gouvernement Sarde s’est décidé
à étendre aux produits du sol les principes qu’il avait
appliqués aux produits de l’industrie, et à réduire les
droits sur les denrées alimentaires étrangères.</p>

<p class='c018'>Le pays produisant beaucoup de vins, les producteurs
parvinrent sous le dernier régime à faire frapper
les liquides étrangers de droits énormes. Avant 1847
les vins étaient soumis:</p>

<p class='c018'>S’ils étaient d’une valeur de 20 fr. et au dessous, au
droit de 16 par hect.;</p>

<p class='c018'>S’ils étaient de valeur supérieure, au droit de 10 par
hect., plus le 30% sur la valeur;</p>

<p class='c018'>et les eaux-de-vie de 22 degrés et au dessous, au
droit de 22 par hect.;</p>

<p class='c018'>de degré supérieur, au droit de 40 par hect.</p>

<p class='c018'>En 1850 un traité stipulé avec la France réduisit
les droits</p>

<p class='c018'>Malgré ces réductions, les droits étaient encore
hautement protecteurs, surtout par rapport aux vins
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>communs. En effet les vins du Languedoc ne pouvant
être évalués à plus de 10 francs l’hectolitre, il s’en
suit qu’ils avaient à payer, pour pénétrer en Piémont,
un droit du cent pour cent sur la valeur.</p>

<p class='c018'>La réduction du droit sur les vins présentait toutefois
de sérieuses difficultés. La plupart des provinces
du Continent et de la Sardaigne étant couvertes de
vignobles, il était à craindre qu’une réforme un peu
hardie ne soulevat parmi les producteurs et par
contre-coup dans le Parlement, une opposition difficile
à vaincre.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pour arriver plus facilement à son but, le Ministère
se décida à faire de la réduction des droits sur les
vins et les eaux-de-vie l’objet de négociations avec la
France, afin d’en obtenir en retour une diminution
des droits qui pèsent sur deux de nos principaux
articles d’exportation—les huiles et les bestiaux.
Dans ce but un nouveau traité fut signé avec la
France, qui parmi les concessions réciproques qu’il
stipulait, réduisait les divers droits sur les vins au
droit uniforme de 3,30 par hectolitre; et ceux sur
les eaux-de-vie</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>à 5, 50 de 22 degrés et au dessous,</div>
      <div class='line'>à 10 — de degré supérieur.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Lorsque le traité fut connu, une vive émotion se
manifesta parmi les propriétaires de vignobles.
Toutefois cette émotion n’eut pas de suite dans les
provinces du Piémont; elle ne prit pas de couleur
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>politique et elle ne tarda pas à se calmer. Le parti
libéral avait trop ouvertement prôné les théories du
libre échange, pour pouvoir embrasser la cause des
producteurs de vins: et quant au parti rétrograde, il
est trop faible pour exercer une influence sérieuse sur
le public ou sur les masses.</p>

<p class='c018'>Il n’en fut pas de même en Savoie. Quoique prise
dans son ensemble, cette partie des Etats Sardes ne
produise pas le vin qui est nécessaire à sa consommation,
la province de Chambéry possède une grande
quantité de vignobles, et les propriétaires de vignes y
exercent une influence considérable. Il était naturel
par conséquent qu’il ne fissent créer dans la capitale
de la Savoie une agitation très-vive. Le parti rétrograde,
qui est beaucoup plus nombreux et puissant
dans cette ville que partout ailleurs, sut en profiter
avec une extrême habilité il parvint à donner, à une
question purement locale, le caractère d’une question
nationale pour la Savoie.</p>

<p class='c018'>La Savoie compte bien plusieurs députés libéraux;
mais malheureusement ils étaient en congé lorsque le
traité fut présenté à la Chambre; de sorte qu’au premier
abord la Députation Savoisienne parut unanime
pour repousser le traité.</p>

<p class='c018'>Plus tard, il est vrai, cet état fâcheux se modifia.
Plusieurs Députés s’empressèrent de quitter leurs
montagnes pour venir protester contre les doctrines
illibérales de leurs collègues. Néanmoins ils ne parvinrent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>pas à détruire l’impression produite par ceux-ci,
et il était facile à reconnaître que le principal
obstacle que rencontrerait le traité dans les Chambres,
viendrait de l’opinion que la Savoie lui était en
grande majorité hostile.</p>

<p class='c018'>C’est pourquoi, le Ministre des Finances, dans le
discours prononcé a cette occasion, s’est attaché à
traiter la question spécialement du point de vue
savoyard.</p>

<p class='c018'>Malgré cette tendance spéciale, ce discours contient
une exposition exacte et consciencieuse des principes
économiques et politiques qui guident depuis trois
ans le Cabinet dont M. d’Azeglio est le chef. C’est
pourquoi nous avons pensé qu’il pouvait présenter
quelque intérêt pour le public anglais, que nous savons
animé d’une si vive sympathie pour une nation généreuse
qui, au milieu des plus graves difficultés et des
obstacles de tous genres, a su demeurer fidèle à la
cause de l’ordre et de la liberté; tout en accomplissant
une réforme économique non moins étendue, non
moins considérable, toute proportion d’ailleurs gardée,
que celle qu’une suite d’hommes d’Etat célèbres
a opéré en Angleterre avec un si éclatant
succès.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Pregiatissimo Signor Mio,</p>

<p class='c019'>Ho esaminato il Catalogo della Biblioteca
per ciò che risguarda l’arte e la scienza militare: è
assai sprovvista delle opere più istruttive, e che sono
uscite a luce durante e dopo le guerre di Napoleone.
Così è pure dell’ <span lang="en" xml:lang="en"><i>United Service Institution</i></span>, a cui sono
stato ammesso per consultare le opere che mi abbisognano
pel componimento del lavoro militare che ho
tra mano. In seguito di ciò ne ho fatte venire parecchie
dalla Francia a mie spese; ma in appresso avrei
d’uopo di consultare l’opera, di cui le accludo il titolo,
e <em>La grande Tactique du Marquis de Ternay,
Colonel d’Etat Major</em>. Quelle opere, in ispecie quella
di Martray, non mi è dato procurarle perchè troppo
dispendiose. Se ella credesse di proporre alla Biblioteca
di farle venire, sarebbe per me una grande utilità.
L’opera di Ternay, edizione di Parigi, non deve costare
più di franchi 25; quella di Bruxelles assai meno.</p>

<p class='c018'>L’opera che sto compiendo sarà in Inglese, e conterrà
tutto che deve sapersi in campagna dal sottotenente
delle tre armi onde si compone un esercito, fino
allo Stato Maggior Generale inclusivamente. E un
peso assai grave, molto più che deve essere ristretto in
un volume tascabile, e riunire <em>concisione</em>, <em>chiarezza</em>, e
utto lo <em>scibile militare</em>. Io mi riprometto tuttavia di,
riuscire sia pei buoni studi che feci fino da giovane
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>come per l’assiduità, e diligenza che vi metterò. E
tuttavia un lavoro che non posso recare a termine prima
di sei o otto mesi.</p>

<p class='c018'>Mentre sto scrivendo, posso però disporre di alcune
ore al giorno per altre occupazioni; ed amerei, se fosse
possibile, di dare alcune lezioni di lingua e letteratura
italiana, e di arte e scienza militare. Per questa
seconda parte io già fui Maggiore di Stato Maggiore, e
posso dare lezioni assai estese: per la prima pure sono
alquanto innanzi.</p>

<p class='c018'>Sino ad ora io condussi una vita oltremodo agitata
e di mezzo sempre ai pericoli: fui per conseguenza a
carico della famiglia, che soffrì non lievi perdite a mia
cagione. Ed ora mettendomi un po’ più tranquillo ho
in animo di trar profitto delle mie cognizioni, mentre
sto aspettando il desiderato momento in cui possa di
nuovo battermi per la nostra indipendenza. Per far
conoscere che sarei pronto a dar lezioni mi si consiglia
di mettere un avviso nel <cite>Times</cite>. Io non vorrei far ciò.
Sembrerebbe che volessi profittare del buon nome che
ho, benchè immeritamente. Credo invece che, ove la
S. V. volesse, potrebbe assai giovarmi col mezzo delle
sue relazioni. Comunque sia, io me ne starò piena
mente ai consigli di lei.</p>

<p class='c018'>Ella però non conosce la mia privata vita: su ciò le
do ampie facoltà, e può indirizzarsi agli stessi miei
nemici o di opinioni, o di partiti, o di altra specie, chè
tutti ne abbiamo. Quanto alle lingue conosco benissimo
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>la francese, e mi disimpegno quanto all’inglese
per lezioni private.</p>

<p class='c018'>Le ho scritto la presente, perchè temeva di recarle
disturbo; se avrà la cortesia la S. V. di darmi un
cenno, potrò recarmi da lei quando le piacerà, onde
prender su quanto le ho scritto miglior consiglio.</p>

<p class='c018'>Venendo ora alle cose politiche, io non so nulla di
positivo: mi tengo, siccome le dissi, indipendente da
ognuno: e se il Governo sardo stimasse di potersi
valere di quel poco ch’io valgo in qualunque impresa
per quanto audace potesse essere, io sono sempre
pronto. Beninteso per la indipendenza della mia
patria: per la quale fin da che conobbi non ebbi mai
quiete, e sagrificai <em>tutto</em>. Nel dire di essere pronto a
dar mano al Governo sardo non sono influenzato che
dall’amore del mio paese, e dalla convinzione che
oggi, se egli vuole, è il solo Governo che possa fare
l’Italia indipendente, una e grande: ed io mi reputerò
felice se in un fatto d’<em>importanza</em> e di <em>gravi conseguenze</em>
per gli oppressori dell’Italia potrò adoperarmi con
tutte le forze, e finire anche una vita che non fu per
me fino ad ora che triste, passionata e melanconica.
Mi perdoni questa espansione d’animo.</p>

<p class='c018'>Da quanto sento, pare che il mio libretto abbia
avuto qualche incontro anche in Piemonte presso
qualunque partito: certo che io nulla esagerai; mi
studiai per anco di far conoscere che debbesi sagrificare
qualunque principio politico alla indipendenza nazionale;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>ed io così feci fino dalla mia prima prigionía del
1844.</p>

<p class='c018'>Non mi occorrendo altro significarle, la supplico di
avermi per iscusato, e rispettosamente me le offro</p>

<div class='c011'>“Leri, 24 Ottobre (1859).</div>

<p class='c018'>“Carissimo Panizzi,</p>

<p class='c019'>La vostra lettera del 17 andante mi fu consegnata
solo ieri, troppo tardi per potere rispondervi
lo stesso giorno. Mi affretto a farlo questa mattina,
benchè io stimi che questa risposta debba giungere
a Londra quando la questione del Congresso sarà
stata decisa.</p>

<p class='c018'>Che allo stato delle cose, a fronte degl’impegni
assunti a Villafranca e sino ad un certo punto confermati
a Zurigo dall’Imperatore, un Congresso
europeo sia una necessità, parmi cosa evidente. Ove
il Congresso non si riunisse, e la Francia impedisse
l’Italia centrale dall’uscire del provvisorio col contrastare
le decretate fusioni, quei paesi sarebbero
esposti a gravi pericoli. Nelle Romagne gli uomini
superlativi, e colà ve ne son molti, potrebbero spingere
Garibaldi a tentare un’impresa nelle Marche e fors’anche
negli Abruzzi; a Modena l’occupazione per
parte dell’Austria dell’Oltrepò Mantovano, conseguenza
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>inevitabile del trattato, potrebbe far nascere
collisioni dannose; la Toscana forse potrebbe sopportare
più a lungo una condizione incerta, ma anche
colà le mène dei retrivi secondate dai preti produrrebbero
forse gravi perturbazioni. Il Congresso
adunque è richiesto dagli stessi interessi dell’Italia.
Ciò ammesso, l’Inghilterra deve parteciparvi e per
decoro suo e pel bene nostro. L’Austria non contrasterà
il suo intervento, e ammetterà le sue riserve,
quando si stabilisca che nel medesimo non abbia a
farsi parola delle provincie sulle quali conserva il suo
impero. E duro l’avere a rinunziare ad alzare la
voce a favore dell’infelice Venezia; eppure è forza il
far tacere le più vive simpatie per non sacrificare il
possibile al desiderabile.</p>

<p class='c018'>L’Austria, rassicurata sul Veneto, dovrà acconsentire
alia massima inglese, che si abbia a rispettare
i voti degl’Italiani. Per dare a questa forma più
diplomatica, basterebbe il dire che le Potenze s’impegnano
a non imporre colle armi una forma qualunque
di governo ai popoli dell’Italia centrale. Questo
è il principio di non intervento già, proclamato dall’Imperatore
nei suoi scritti e nei suoi discorsi. Propugnato
dalla Francia e dall’Inghilterra e fors’anche
dalla Russia, sarà subíto dall’Austria ed accettato
dalla Prussia.</p>

<p class='c018'>Passando quindi alla costituzione del Congresso,
non esito a pronunziarmi per l’esclusione delle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>Potenze minori. Se si trattasse solo dei Ducati e
della Toscana, il loro intervento sarebbe giovevole;
ma siccome la questione la più ardua e dirò pure la
più importante è quella delle Romagne, temerei che
il Papa avesse a trovare nella Spagna e nel Portogallo
ardenti difensori.</p>

<p class='c018'>Il Congresso riunito, la condotta dell’Inghilterra
non può essere dubbia. Proporrebbe dapprima che i
voti dei popoli legalmente espressi ricevessero la
sanzione dell’Europa. Questa proposta essendo
rigettata, proporrebbe che i popoli venissero interrogati
pel mezzo del suffragio universale, da constatarsi
dai rappresentanti del Congresso. Questa proposta
troverebbe appoggio nella Francia, e sarebbe probabilmente
accettata.</p>

<p class='c018'>Quando nol fosse, l’Inghilterra dovrebbe entrare in
una fase negativa e contrastare le proposte dell’Austria
ed anche quelle della Francia. Il Duca di
Modena essendo da tutti, non esclusi i suoi congiunti,
abbandonato, non si avrà a combattere che la ristaurazione
della Casa di Lorena in Toscana, l’installazione
della Duchessa di Parma a Modena, ed il ristabilimento
del dominio papale nelle Romagne.</p>

<p class='c018'>Queste determinazioni si possono combattere non
solo in virtù dei diritti dei popoli, ma altresì e più
efficacemente ancora nell’interesse del principio
monarchico, e delle idee d’ordine e di conservazione.
Se si vuole che la rivoluzione ora schiacciata non
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>ritorni minacciosa e potente, non bisogna porla a
fronte di Governi deboli, senza radici, senza forze nè
fisiche nè morali; se si vuole che i troni sieno
rispettati, conviene non farvi sedere Principi disprezzati
e disprezzabili, il di cui solo nome è in contrasto
irritante col sentimento ora dominante in Italia, il
sentimento nazionale. Ritorni il Granduca o suo
figlio a Firenze; ed in men di un mese la Toscana
sarà il quartier generale di Mazzini e della rivoluzione
militante. Forse si dirà che la Duchessa di Parma è
donna forte e non disprezzata. Quando ciò fosse
vero, non si potrebbero cancellare le memorie del
padre cotanto odiose, ed ispirare fiducia nel figlio.
D’altronde quel sistema dei compensi che se vorrebbe
applicare a favore di questo ramo borbonico, è in
urto diretto coi sentimenti e le idee che dominano ora
in Europa. I Modanesi sarebbero feriti nella loro
dignità, quando si vedessero assegnare in guisa di
<em>douaire</em> alla vedova dello scellerato Duchino di
Parma. Meglio per loro la ristaurazione dell’antico
sovrano. In quel caso sarebbero vittima di un falso
principio; ma non sarebbero trattati come un branco
di pecore, di cui si dispone per fare accetare da una
delle parti contraenti condizioni da lei riputate
onerose.</p>

<p class='c018'>Il Trattato di Vienna ha molte parti odiose; pure
è men odiabile di quel di Campoformio.</p>

<p class='c018'>Rispetto alle Romagne sarà facile all’Inghilterra il
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>far respingere l’idea delle riforme papali. Accettandola,
si fa peggio che una cosa odiosa, si fa una cosa
ridicola. Non e necessario di essere un gran statista
nè gran teologo per rimanere convinti che il Papa non
solo non vuole, ma non può acconsentire a serieriforme.
Finchè sarà Papa e Re, dovrà in coscienza
impiegare le forze del Re per fare rispettare i decreti
del Pontefice. La separazione dei due poteri non è
possibile. Il Papa non può acconsentire nè alla
libertà dell’insegnamento, nè alla libertà dei culti, nè
alla libertà della stampa. Non può tollerare le libertà
municipali, salvochè per queste s’intenda la facoltà di
regolare a beneplacito dei Municipi le strade consortili
ed i lastricati delle strade. Il Papa, come
Papa, subirà, più facilmente la perdita di una provincia,
che non la promulgazione nei suoi Stati del
Codice civile napoleonico. La ristaurazione papale
deve impedirsi ad ogni costo; è questione non solo
italiana, ma d’interesse europeo. Importa a noi, ma
importa pure all’Inghilterra, alla Prussia, alla Russia
stessa, a tutti i paesi ove si vuole lo sviluppo della
civiltà, il quale richiede come condizione essenziale la
separazione assoluta dei due poteri. Se il Papa conseguisse
una vittoria in Italia, la tracotanza e l’orgoglio
dei Cullen e dei McHale crescerebbe a dismisura,
e l’Europa sarebbe minacciata in non lontano avvenire
dal pericolo di lotte religiose analoghe a quelle dei
secoli scorsi. Si ceda su tutto anzichè sacrificare le
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>Romagne. La lor causa, lo ripeto, è la causa della
civiltà.</p>

<p class='c018'>Quando l’Inghilterra riesca ad allontanare le proposte
austro-franche, torni a mettere in campo le
primitive sue, ed ove non prevalgano, proponga
l’unione immediata di Parma e Carrara al Piemonte
e lo stabilimento di un Governo provvisorio, ma fortemente
costituito, che riunisca sotto di sè Firenze,
Modena e Bologna.</p>

<p class='c018'>Ecco il mio parere, ve lo do per quel che vale.
Lontano dagli affari, con poche relazioni coi Ministri,
ignoro forse molte cose che modificare potrebbero la
mia opinione. Tuttavia giudicando la questione
dell’Italia centrale dai dati che sono in certo modo
acquistati alla storia, porto ferma opinione che, ove
l’Inghilterra seguisse la via de me tracciata, riuscirebbe
nell’intento di assicurare le sorti dell’Italia
centrale con utile nostro e gloria sua.</p>

<p class='c018'>Addio, carissimo amico; proseguite a perorare la
nostra causa presso la nobile nazione inglese, ed i
vostri sforzi non rimarranno sterili. Ripeto ora quel
che dicevo in febbraio alla Camera ed all’Italia: Gli
uomini di Stato, che hanno onorata la loro camera col
compiere l’emancipazione dei neri, non vorranno condannare
l’Italia ad eterno servaggio.</p>

<p class='c018'>The list of illustrations does not have a reference to an image appearing
on p. <a href='#i161'>161</a>. The subject of that illustration is unclear.  There is
scant resemblance between this image and that on p. <a href='#Page_154'>154</a>, whihc is
clearly (from the text), Felice Orsini.</p>

<p class='c018'>The French passages in the Appendix liberally employ three asterisks to
indicate an elided name, e.g., 'Madame L——’.  These have been replaced
by a long dash.</p>

<p class='c018'>A footnote on p. <a href='#Page_255'>255</a> had no anchor in the text. An anchor has been added at
what seems an appropriate place.</p>

<p class='c018'>On p. <a href='#Page_252'>252</a>, the passage beginning ‘“You say that we are behindhand’ uses the
continuating quotation in mid-line, following an ellipsis. This would seem
to be a printer’s error. A new paragraph is assumed.</p>

<p class='c018'>A spelling discrepancy between the text and the Index for Count `Mammiani´ (index)
and `Mammiana´ (text) was resolved as a reference to Count Mammiani of Persano.</p>

<p class='c018'>There were a number of instances of inconsistent or apparently incorrect
diacritical marks in the French passages.  Most were corrected to adhere
to other instances of the preferred spelling,  except where accents were entirely
absent, in which as the text remains as printed.</p>

<p class='c018'>Other minor irregularities of punctuation in the Index were corrected with no
further remark. The Index also includes one obvious error, the final reference
to Lord Brougham, in Vol I, p. 399. The first volume ends with p. 389. The
page number was changed to p. 329, where a final letter from Lord Brougham
appears.</p>

<p class='c018'>The following errors were deemed most likely to be the printer’s and have
been corrected, and are noted here. The references are to the page and line
in the original. The ‘c’ refers to the Contents, which were not paginated.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
